Participants: Insung and Soo.

Insung opens the conversation by stating he feels a sense of futility because he has not accomplished much during the day. Soo responds by expressing a casual and frequent desire for suicide, feeling that they have done nothing over the past year. Soo remarks that if they were still in Hong Kong, they would have committed suicide. Insung agrees with the sentiment of wanting to die but expresses a specific aversion to dying in Korea. Insung states that if he truly wanted to commit suicide, he would purchase a plane ticket to go elsewhere rather than dying in Korea.

Soo mentions they are currently living in their parents' house. When Insung asks if their parents would be upset if they died there, Soo responds with indifference, noting it is their house as well. Insung mentions that in Korea, the police conduct thorough investigations into the phones, internet history, and KakaoTalk records of those who commit suicide, which Soo finds unpleasant.

Soo expresses deep unhappiness and questions why their life feels so difficult. Insung points out that Soo has started school and met friends since arriving in Korea, suggesting that life is not bad because of something Soo did wrong. Soo expresses a desire for an accidental death, such as being hit by a car, to avoid the responsibility of suicide. Insung argues against this, citing the physical pain involved in such an accident.

Insung mentions it is Christmas Eve and he is currently in Jung-gu. He describes the area as being very crowded and compares the atmosphere to Tsim Sha Tsui in Hong Kong. Insung expresses a desire to return to Hong Kong.

Soo expresses a strong desire to drink alcohol. Insung suggests they drink together on the coming Friday. Insung mentions his doctor advised him not to drink frequently, but said it is acceptable as long as he does not exceed two drinking sessions per week. Insung expresses a desire to take Soo to a place called Dong-seo Bar in the future, though he characterizes it as being "too gay" and similar to Hong Kong, lacking a specific "Korean charm."

Insung mentions feeling a self-imposed obligation to eat a lot of Korean food while he is in the country, even though he has no appetite and has to force himself to eat. Soo suggests that this obligation might stem from Insung not feeling like Korea is his own country. Soo notes they might feel a similar pressure to eat specific foods if they were in Japan or studying in the United States.

Soo reports feeling mentally unstable and having a headache. They mention that a friend is currently at their house, but they want the friend to leave. Soo later 배웅 (sees off) the friend while pretending to be sad that the friend is departing.

Soo reveals they are under significant stress because a person named Jang is ignoring or ghosting their messages. Soo admits to having an obsession with Jang, explaining that receiving attention from Jang makes them feel at peace. Soo reflects that it is a mistake to treat a person as a means of salvation and describes their current situation as a bad case study. Soo acknowledges they knew they could not date Jang but had hoped to remain connected to them.

Insung reflects on his own behavior, stating that he is not necessarily in a bad situation but has a tendency to be overly dissatisfied and interpret his circumstances with excessive negativity.
