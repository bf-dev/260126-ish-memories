Insung woke up late on July 2. Insung's maternal grandmother visited him. Insung and his grandmother ate breakfast together. Insung went to the Ilsan Costco with his grandmother, a trip he had originally planned for July 1. At Costco, Insung observed a high volume of cars and people. He was informed that although it was busy on a weekday, the crowds are even larger on weekends. 

Insung used a cart to browse the store and found peanut butter on sale at a very low price. Insung purchased three boxes of peanut butter, with each box containing six jars. Insung also bought dry shampoo because he anticipates being outdoors frequently for a meeting scheduled on July 9. Insung purchased a rotisserie chicken for a price between 7,000 and 7,900 KRW. He noted that this chicken provided enough food for three days. Insung considered other items but decided against them due to their large volume. A bag was purchased for Insung during the trip. 

Insung observed that cola with unlimited refills was sold for 500 KRW. He noted the presence of staff members dedicated to pushing carts and others dedicated to managing the elevators. Insung observed that many business owners utilize Costco. Although Insung originally planned to go to Costco alone, he went with others to assist with carrying items like the rotisserie chicken and other supplies. Insung also purchased Icheon rice Hetbahn (instant rice) at Costco.

Insung received a phone call from his father while he was out. Insung felt stressed and found the situation awkward, so he did not want to take the call. Upon returning, Insung discovered the call was regarding the administrative procedure to cancel a Chinese mobile phone plan since Insung is now living in Korea. 

In the morning, Insung received a text message regarding an AliExpress delivery. The delivery was an AirPods charging case. Insung's original AirPods were not pairing, though the individual earbud units were functional. After receiving the new case, Insung confirmed that the AirPods worked well. 

Before leaving the house again, Insung ate some of the rotisserie chicken and stored the remainder in the refrigerator. Insung procrastinated and moved slowly before heading out. Insung traveled for one hour on the Gyeongui-Jungang Line to reach Yongsan Station. Insung walked to the back section of Nodeul Island via the Hangang Bridge. He had originally intended to go to Yeouido but did not have enough time. Insung walked around the island and found the scenery beautiful. Insung felt slightly depressed because the people around him appeared very happy. 

Insung installed a bicycle-sharing app called Swing. He signed up for a free trial of the Swing Pass, noting that he would need to cancel it later to avoid charges. Insung went to a convenience store and purchased a bottle of water for approximately 2,000 KRW using Apple Pay. Insung returned to Yongsan Station because he wanted to go home. Feeling hungry and as though he had been unproductive, Insung went to Lotteria and ate a Bulgogi Burger. Insung then walked and took the Gyeongui-Jungang Line subway to return home.
