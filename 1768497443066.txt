The conversation takes place between two individuals named Soo and Insung. Soo provides a list of five people currently relevant to her personal life. The first is Yoo Ah-rim, who is an old crush. The second is an individual referred to as Jang. The third is Andrew. The fourth is a female junior who asked Soo if she likes women and is currently pursuing her. The fifth is a woman Soo is in contact with.

Insung describes this lineup as being at the level of a mental hospital. Insung asks if the junior is a high school student. Soo describes the junior as being very forward, despite Soo attempting to set boundaries. The junior has told Soo she is cute, asked why she is not dating, and jokingly suggested they date. Soo responded to these advances by stating she is very old. Insung suggests that Soo should provide vague openings if she is interested, but Soo clarifies she has no interest in the junior. Soo believes that starting a relationship with the junior while her situation with Jang is unresolved would be unfair and potentially hurtful to the junior.

Soo admits that she has not been able to organize her emotions regarding Jang and acknowledges that she liked Jang more than she previously admitted. Soo feels that among the five people mentioned, Yoo Ah-rim is the most favorable because there were genuine feelings involved.

Soo expresses significant fear and anxiety about calling Jang. Although she considers a phone call, she decides to send a long text message instead to make the process less painful. During the stress of the situation, Soo mentions someone named Ye-won and says she misses her. Soo also refers to herself as an attention whore.

Jang reads Soo's long message immediately. Soo describes Jang as having a dominant or blunt personality, using the term sship-tap. In the message, Soo told Jang that she felt insulted and mocked by Jang's recent treatment of her. Jang replies by apologizing and explaining that the lack of communication was due to exhaustion after a sixteen-hour flight. Jang characterizes the lack of contact as a personal failure rather than just an excuse.

Soo is surprised by Jang's apologetic response. She had expected Jang to either treat her like a person with mental health issues or to suggest they end the relationship because both parties were struggling. Soo observes that Jang is continuing to type more messages and decides to wait for the full response before replying. To manage her stress while waiting, Soo uses an electronic cigarette and considers going to sleep, though Insung questions if she will be able to sleep given the circumstances. Insung remains supportive throughout the conversation, encouraging Soo and asking for updates on the situation.
