The date of the record is July 4, 2025. On this morning, Insung woke up and spent some time lounging before taking a bus to attend his actual road driving test. The driving test lasted for four hours, during which he repeatedly drove courses A, B, C, and D. Insung found the test very difficult, specifically noting that cornering was hard. He observed other drivers traveling fast above the speed limit and felt scared and in physical danger because of the high number of trucks on the road. A person identified as a nurse appeared to be very exhausted. During the test, Insung was instructed not to step on the brakes because it was considered more dangerous to do so. Insung described himself as a crazy person or weirdo in the context of the driving situation. It was a rainy day, and for the first two hours of driving, his vision was blurry due to the rain, though the rain stopped for the final two hours.

After the driving test ended, Insung was headed home when his maternal grandmother called and asked him to go somewhere with her. Insung contacted Kang Ga-yeon to ask what she wanted to eat, and she said she did not want chicken. Kang Min-seo said he really wanted chicken but was also fine with pig's feet. Insung and his maternal grandmother went to buy pig's feet. They parked at a public health center because the parking at the original destination was strange. After waiting and picking up Ryu, they went to Insung's aunt's house. 

Insung's mother was dealing with bug bites. There was a legal or administrative issue involving a person referred to as Mecca and the ownership of a car. To address this, Insung went to a private investigator's office. 

Back at the aunt's house, they waited for the aunt to arrive. They eventually ate the pig's feet and watched television. Insung talked about world affairs with his maternal grandmother. The grandmother remarked to Kang Ga-yeon that young people today lack common knowledge of current affairs. Insung admitted that he also lacks such knowledge. It was noted that Kang Ga-yeon still uses the web portal Nate, which is associated with the Cyworld era. She also reads economic news but finds politics boring. 

When the aunt arrived home, she immediately opened a canned beer. Insung noticed there were about six cans at the house, suggesting she drinks almost every day, and he told her she needs to drink in moderation. Insung and his aunt shared the last available beer, drinking half a can each. Insung felt slightly dizzy even from that small amount. They also ate cookies, which seemed to be a new menu item someone was practicing. 

The aunt and Kang Min-seo played a game that involved matching identical symbols of different sizes and positions on cards. Insung found the game cognitively difficult but thought the game developer was a genius for how the symbols were designed to have exactly one match per card. Playing the game for a few rounds made Insung's head feel dizzy, while Kang Min-seo was very excited. 

After returning home, Insung began writing a backlog of journal entries. He felt a sense of doubt about whether he should contact Olivia. Following his personal philosophy to always take action when he feels such doubt, he contacted her immediately. He received a prompt reply and felt mentally comforted.
