Insung is a professor from the University of Hong Kong who presented details about the new School of Innovation and the Bachelor of Science in Innovation and Technology program. The School of Innovation, also referred to as the I-School, is one of two new schools at the university, with the other being the School of Computing and Data Science. The I-School and the BSc in Innovation and Technology are scheduled to launch in September 2025, with the curriculum currently pending approval. The JUPAS code for the program is 6602.

The vision of the I-School according to Insung is to reimagine education for future tech innovators through an interdisciplinary and impact-driven approach. The BSc(I&T) program is designed as a first-of-its-kind curriculum that is project-led and problem-based. The core of the program consists of seven open-ended project challenges conducted over four years. Students work with various community partners including kindergartens, science museums, elderly NGOs, and the deep tech industry. The learning process moves from ideation to prototyping and pitching.

The academic foundation of the program integrates the four pillars of Science, Technology, Design, and Entrepreneurship. Students are permitted to customize their technology focus by taking elective courses from the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Science. A compulsory component of the program is the co-op education requirement in Year 3, which entails a six to eight month full-time internship. These internships are intended to take place at startups located overseas or in mainland China. The curriculum also includes a capstone project in the final year to consolidate student learning.

The I-School structure is supported by four major HKU faculties: Engineering, Architecture, Science, and Business. It integrates three primary areas: Teaching and Learning, Research, and Knowledge Exchange. The school aims to foster global impact through university-industry collaboration and connections with innovation ecosystems such as the Greater Bay Area, Cyberport, and the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks.

Insung describes the ideal student profile as individuals who are innovative, creative, and enjoy solving problems for themselves and others. These students should have a passion for STEM and hands-on projects. Insung emphasizes that students must not be afraid of failure, as innovation requires iteration. Insung uses an analogy where a mathematician proves a solution exists, a scientist studies it, and an engineer builds a wall, but an I-School student pragmatically puts out a fire with a bucket of water.

Two illustrative examples of innovation were provided in the presentation. The first is the Apollo 13 mission, specifically the square peg in a round hole problem involving a carbon dioxide canister adapter. This was solved using limited resources including duct tape, plastic bags, and cardboard. The second example is Clearbot, a startup founded by HKU Engineering students in 2019 following a trip to Bali. Clearbot uses AI-powered robotic boats to collect marine plastic. The company now has a team of 18 members with operations in Hong Kong, India, Thailand, and Singapore.

Regarding admission, the program expects a small and selective cohort of 25 to 30 students. Admission requirements for DSE scores are generally similar to Engineering programs, but scores are not the sole factor for entry. Insung stated that ICT or STEM experience, such as participation in robotics competitions, is considered valuable. Admission bootcamps are scheduled for January 2025, May 2025, and July 2025. These bootcamps are used to evaluate hands-on skills, problem-solving aptitude, creativity, and teamwork. Career paths for graduates include entrepreneurship through starting their own companies or intrapreneurship by leading innovation projects within large corporations.
