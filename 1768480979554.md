The document is a paper titled Sexuality, Gender, and My Life, authored by Insung Cho, whose student identification number is 3036526347. Insung is a student at The University of Hong Kong. The work was submitted for the course CCHU9007 SEXUALITY AND GENDER, taught by Dr. Brenda.

Insung grew up in South Korea and also lived in China. In South Korea, he attended a high school where sexuality and gender were not discussed seriously and homosexuality was frequently treated as a joke or used as an insult against men perceived as lacking masculinity. In China, Insung attended an international school with Christian teachers and students where homosexuality was viewed as a sin, and discussions regarding sexuality and gender were not permitted. Insung initially viewed his own sexual orientation as a problem to be fixed or ignored.

Upon moving to Hong Kong, Insung felt he could breathe and see queer lives openly for the first time. He describes the environment as making him feel safe and unjudged. Through the course at The University of Hong Kong, Insung learned academic language to describe his experiences and realized that gender identity and sexual orientation exist on a spectrum. He confronted internalized homophobia and previous feelings of self-hatred stemming from messages received at school and home. Insung identifies as a male individual who is homosexual. He currently meets with queer friends and visits queer spaces, though he notes he is still in the process of figuring things out and currently avoids labeling himself.

The paper discusses two guest speakers: Dr. Zephyrus and Dr. Bella. Dr. Zephyrus is a medical doctor in Hong Kong who identifies as a transgender male and has personal lived experience as a transgender individual. From this speaker, Insung learned that the waiting time for hormone replacement treatment in Hong Kong public hospitals can be several years. There is only one medical institution in all of Hong Kong providing transgender care. Dr. Zephyrus highlighted that gender-affirming care is often treated as elective by the system despite being urgent and lifesaving for many. Dr. Bella is a transgender woman, a tourism scholar, and an advocate for inclusive tourism for queer people. She shared an experience of being forced to live in a male dormitory at Hong Kong Polytechnic University because the institution assigned housing based on her legal documents rather than her medical status or gender identity.

Insung recounts a personal story about a former friend who was a transgender woman assigned male at birth. This friend was pursuing a career in computer science. She suffered from depression related to her situation and the effects of hormone replacement treatment. After Insung and the friend stopped speaking following an argument, he learned she had committed suicide due to her family's denial of her transgender situation. Her family did not hold a funeral for her.

The document reviews films from a festival, likely the Hong Kong Lesbian & Gay Film Festival or HKLGFF. The short film When the Petal Falls depicts an elderly pedophile who is attracted to a young boy but chooses not to act on that attraction. Insung notes that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality as a mental disorder from the International Classification of Diseases or ICD in 1990. He suggests that while actions without consent or with minors are illegal and immoral, attraction itself is a part of the mind that requires cultural relativism. The film White Ballet Skirt tells the story of a boy who dreams of a white ballet skirt but faces oppression from his father. The father eventually throws the boy's dress into the trash. Insung identifies with the boy in this film, feeling that he does not fit into the masculinity expectations of society. Insung criticizes queerbaiting in mainstream media, which he defines as commercializing queerness without explicitly depicting queer people.

Insung differentiates between four specific subcultures. Drag is tied to queer culture and performance where individuals exaggerate femininity or masculinity. Impersonation focuses on copying a specific person, such as a celebrity, including their voice and mannerisms. Cross-dressing involves wearing clothes not traditionally linked to one's identified gender, but it does not change the person's gender identity. Cosplay involves dressing as fictional characters from anime, games, or movies.

Insung proposes a draft for a four-chapter comprehensive sex education program for high school students titled Identity, Safety, and Respect. Chapter one focuses on SOGIESC concepts and teaching that gender and sexuality are spectrums. Chapter two covers practical safety, specifically how to use protection like condoms and dental dams and providing information on where to get tested for STDs in Hong Kong. Chapter three focuses on consent, healthy relationships, and digital safety. Chapter four is dedicated to mental health and providing a list of resources from NGOs and government-operated hotlines. Insung cites a 2024 survey by The Trevor Project which states that queer teens are approximately four times more likely to attempt suicide than straight, cisgender teens.

Regarding HIV and AIDS, the paper mentions the concept of U=U, which stands for Undetectable equals Untransmittable. This refers to the medical fact that people with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load through treatment cannot transmit the virus through sexual intercourse. Insung states that people with AIDS have the right to a sexual life but have a non-negotiable obligation to inform their partners of their health status. He argues that the stigma associated with STDs causes people to avoid testing for fear of being outed to family or doctors. Insung concludes that stigmatization is an ineffective public health strategy that makes people hide and avoid treatment.
