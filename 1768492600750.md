Subject name: Insung
Subject perspective: Insung argues that the moral law cannot be classified as an instinct because of its unique operational nature.
Definition of instincts: Insung describes instincts as innate, biologically driven desires.
Purpose of instincts: Instincts serve to guide actions toward survival or reproduction.
Cognitive nature of instincts: Instincts often function without the need for conscious thought.
Examples of instincts: Insung identifies eating when hungry, avoiding danger, and protecting children as primary instincts.
Biological goal of child protection: The instinct to protect offspring is intended to preserve genes.
Characteristics of instincts: Instincts are described as immediate and compelling.
Nature of moral law: Moral law involves reflection, complex judgments, and the consideration of actions.
Relationship between moral law and desire: Moral law often acts in opposition to immediate desires or instincts.
Functional role of moral law: Moral law serves as an independent judge between conflicting instincts.
Evaluative role of moral law: Moral law provides a standard for evaluating and prioritizing various instincts.
Example of instinctual conflict: Insung cites the conflict between the instinct to preserve one's own life and the instinct to help others who are in danger.
Moral hierarchy: Moral law can determine that helping others is morally superior to self-preservation, even when helping is not instinctively desirable.
Components of moral choice: Insung identifies self-sacrifice, empathy, and fairness as elements of moral choice and reflection.
Complexity comparison: Moral law is more complex than the simpler, self-interested nature of instincts.
Implication for consciousness: The capacity for moral choice points to a more complex aspect of human consciousness.
Purpose of morality: Morality is not limited to survival or immediate gratification.
Social function of morality: Morality is linked to the establishment and maintenance of mutual trust between individuals in a society.
