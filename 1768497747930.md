The conversation takes place on Wednesday, January 14, 2026, between Insung and an individual named Soo.

Insung expresses a preference for dating younger men, which surprises Soo, who expected Insung to prefer older men. Insung clarifies that he does not strictly limit himself by age but specifically prefers partners who are younger, tall, well-dressed, and cute. Despite preferring younger partners, Insung expects his partner to take care of him, a trait he acknowledges is typically associated with older partners. Insung concludes that he is drawn to younger people because he is attracted to those with cute appearances.

Regarding dating dynamics, Insung states that he wants a relationship with minimal emotional exhaustion. He prefers a partner who does not cry easily. He also mentions a specific boundary, stating he finds it awkward and dislikes it when a partner follows him into the bathroom.

Insung went to sleep during the early morning hours of January 14, 2026. On this day, he acknowledges that he needs to start exercising. He has an appointment to meet his aunt in the evening. Insung is scheduled to meet Soo on January 16, but they discuss the possibility of also meeting on January 15.

Insung has a connection to Hong Kong, likely having lived there in a dormitory. He mentions a friend sent him a photo of laundry hanging in front of a dormitory in Hong Kong to make him feel homesick.

Insung provides advice to Soo regarding Soo's attraction to a girl born in 2008 who identifies as a femme. Insung describes himself as having less morality and being more promiscuous than Soo. Despite this self-assessment, Insung advises Soo to end the pursuit of the 2008-born individual. Insung's reasoning is that Soo would not be able to lean on or whine to someone that young, and the relationship would likely lack the emotional depth or type of connection Soo actually desires.

Insung attempts to reassure Soo about various stressors, including Soo's anxiety over booking a flight to Hong Kong by the 19th. Insung insists that there will be plenty of tickets available and encourages Soo by pointing out that Soo is still being productive by exercising and seeking tutoring work or part-time jobs.
