The chat record documents a series of conversations between Insung and a person named Soo, whose full name is identified as Sukyeong.

In an interaction preceding December 13, 2025, Insung shares a personal philosophy regarding love and emotional pain. He tells Soo that he tries to think of himself as not needing to receive love. He explains that if he believes love is unnecessary, he feels less pain. He argues that needing love but failing to receive it is a difficult experience. Insung clarifies that while he has a personal need for love, he believes other people have no obligation or requirement to give it to him because he feels he hasn't done anything to deserve it. He mentions that he used to feel sad about this situation but has now become numb to it. When he asks Soo if these thoughts seem like the product of a mental breakdown or mental illness, Soo asks if her opinion is important to him, and Insung says it is not. Despite the heavy topic, they both exchange the words I love you. Insung tells Soo that she is a person who is worthy of receiving love.

During this same period, Soo mentions she is in a better mood after taking a photo with a good vibe, referred to as neujohsa. She notes that she is wearing clothes borrowed from her cousin. Insung suggests that if she applies a filter to the photo, it will look even better. Soo expresses concern that she might be posting too many social media stories, but Insung encourages her to post a selfie anyway. Insung also mentions that he must have been drunk the previous night because he went around taking photos with random men.

On Saturday, December 13, 2025, Soo contacts Insung to say she accidentally created a social media story with a 2016 aesthetic. Insung remarks that it looks like when they were children and suggests it looks like something that should be posted on Facebook. Soo presents two versions of the photo: the 2016 concept and her original style. Insung says the original style is better because it feels more like her. Soo mentions that a person named Arim liked her story, though Soo felt Arim was the wrong target audience. Soo also notes she missed the timing to post some content because she was busy posting for a friend's birthday.

Later that day, Insung expresses a strong desire to sleep. He reveals that he went to bed at 3:00 AM after suffering from a mental health crisis or breakdown. Soo responds that she is also experiencing a mental health crisis and feels suicidal. She clarifies her current location is South Korea, not Hong Kong. Soo considers the possibility of jumping from her home, noting she lives on the 12th floor. Insung expresses concern that jumping would be painful. They discuss various suicide methods, including an overdose of sleeping pills or drinking heavily before jumping. Soo expresses fear that a failed overdose would lead to a painful stomach pump procedure.

Soo eventually decides that she should not die yet because she wants to go on a planned trip to Bali and does not want to waste the money spent on the hotel package. She believes her parents would not go on the trip if she died. In contrast, Insung discusses his own family dynamic, stating that his father would likely book a flight and go on a trip even if Insung died. Insung suggests that there are people who would be happy if he died, though he acknowledges his mother might be slightly sad. The recorded dialogue concludes with Insung mentioning the concept of utilitarianism.
