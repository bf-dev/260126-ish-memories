Fact Record of Conversation

Date: Saturday, December 20, 2025.
Participants: Insung and Soo (also referred to as Sukyung).

Context of the Conversation:
Insung and Soo are discussing recent events, their personal lives, sexuality, and social media interactions. Insung is the primary subject of the record.

Drinking and Deleted Messages:
Insung admits to being heavily intoxicated the previous night. Several messages were deleted from the chat history. Insung explains that the deleted messages were sent while drunk and included a question asking Soo what time they should meet the next day. Soo notes that it has been a while since they last drank together. Insung states that they have not been drinking since returning to Korea.

Insung's Family and Coming Out:
Insung reports a conversation with their mother. Insung's mother told Insung that it is okay to be gay. Insung does not remember the exact details of the conversation because of being intoxicated. Insung had not explicitly mentioned their sexuality to their mother before, but the mother brought it up herself, indicating she likely already knew. Soo expresses that this is a positive development and suggests the mother had been wanting to say it.

Current Activities and Social Media:
Soo is currently taking a bath in a tub and is texting with only her hands out of the water. Insung mentions seeing Soo's Instagram and compliments a photo of Soo in a bikini, using the slang term "skkrt" to describe it. Soo expresses a desire to live a relaxed lifestyle permanently.

Career Interests:
Soo expresses a strong interest in pursuing hotel management, regardless of her current academic major. She believes she would be happy working in that field even if it involves menial tasks or "dirty work." Insung mentions a YouTube vlog about someone who inherited a hotel, noting that the work involves a lot of different responsibilities.

Nostalgia for Hong Kong and Shenzhen:
Insung expresses a strong desire to go back to Hong Kong, specifically mentioning a longing for the Central district. Insung also misses Shenzhen and expresses a craving for lamb skewers and a specific chili rice restaurant. Soo suggests that Insung should go to Hongdae to eat lamb skewers. Insung notes a conflict where they feel they should eat Korean food while in Korea, even though they find it is not particularly delicious.

Views on Sexuality and Community:
Soo observes that gay men consistently "like" her Instagram stories, referring to it as "gay solidarity." Soo and Insung discuss how they find gay people to be generally better or more fun than heterosexual people. Insung points out that Soo finds gay people fun because Soo herself is gay. They discuss an acquaintance named Yewon-jang; while Yewon-jang claims to be heterosexual, Soo and Insung find that claim ambiguous.

Soo's Self-Reflection on Identity:
Soo shares that she feels she has become "Ace" (asexual/aromantic spectrum). She explains that she finds the behavior of "butches" to be "cringe" (posturing), finds heterosexual men annoying, and finds "femmes" to be merely cute. This feeling has intensified recently.

The Russian Man and Charlie Kirk:
Soo discusses a specific "Russian man" (referred to as Ru-nam or Ru-nam-chung). Soo noticed that the order of people viewing her Instagram stories changed because he was repeatedly checking them. Insung mentions that their own Russian acquaintance has hidden their stories from Insung, though Insung had already restricted that person's account. They conclude that these individuals no longer have value as friends. Soo discovered that her Russian acquaintance follows Charlie Kirk (a US conservative political figure). This surprised her because she viewed the man as a "stupid party boy" who lacked knowledge of US politics. Insung suggests that being "stupid" is a requirement for supporting Charlie Kirk. Soo considers confronting the man about following Charlie Kirk as a source of "dopamine" or entertainment when she returns to Korea and feels bored or mentally stressed. Soo notes that there is no risk in doing this because she can simply block him on Instagram and will never have to see him again, or she could tell him to "come to Hong Kong University (HKU)" if he has a complaint.

Conclusion:
The conversation concludes with an agreement that "stupid men" are the best.
