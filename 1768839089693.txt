Insung is a student who is reflecting on his recent experiences and future plans. He identifies the Senior Departure Seminar (SDS) and a recent drama activity as the most impressive activities he participated in. Insung notes that the drama project was his first and last experience with the subject, and he does not plan to pursue it in the future. Regarding the SDS, he states that it taught him how to live after graduation. Insung mentions that he achieved all of the goals he set in SLC. Throughout his education, he has consistently considered majoring in computer science and has shown growth in math, science, and technology subjects. He specifically credits his science teachers, including Mr. Londi and Mr. Baltha, for helping him deepen his understanding of science and encouraging him to dig deeper into the subjects. He believes these STEM subjects will be helpful for his future major. The highlights of the SDS for Insung included lectures on how to live after graduating from TIS and how to transfer to different cultures, which he found particularly helpful given his current situation. Through the SDS, he learned about managing money and financial statements during university, as well as emotional management and stability skills. Insung is now thinking about his future during the gap between high school and university. He plans to focus on college applications while also trying new things he could not do before. He intends to find work, which he believes will be one of the greatest experiences of his life. While he feels confident about living on his own based on past experiences, he admits that although he understands the theory of budgeting, he does not feel ready for the practicalities of a financial life. His primary uncertainty at the moment is whether he will be accepted into college after high school.
