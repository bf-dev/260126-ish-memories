On January 20, 2026, Insung visited the Western Psychiatric Centre, General Psychiatry GAC7 on the 3rd floor at DTRC. During this visit, Insung received a prescription for Duloxetine (HCL) Delayed Release 60mg capsules to be taken once daily, which was a continuation of his previous dosage. He was prescribed Lorazepam 1mg tablets to be taken as a half tablet (0.5mg) at bedtime as needed, which also matched his previous dosage. A new medication, Mirtazapine Orodispersible 15mg tablets, was added to his prescription to be taken daily at bedtime. The addition of Mirtazapine was intended to address Insung's lack of appetite, low energy, and sleep difficulties, including nightmares. The combination of Duloxetine and Mirtazapine is referred to as California Rocket Fuel, used to create a synergistic effect for treating depression and anxiety.

On January 21, 2026, it was the final day for Insung's friend, Sukyung. Sukyung requested to meet Insung. They were unable to go to Disneyland because Sukyung arrived late for the appointment. Insung became very angry with Sukyung during the day. Instead of Disneyland, they went to see goldfish and ate dim sum. Insung refused to go to Ocean Park with Sukyung, which led to Sukyung feeling dissatisfied and hurt. Insung assisted Sukyung with packing her belongings and met one of her friends. Sukyung's friend questioned Sukyung about whether Insung was a man. Later that evening, Insung went for a walk and was contacted by Elliot. Insung and Elliot went to a bar where Insung became intoxicated. While drunk, Insung sent erratic messages on KakaoTalk and subsequently went to a club.

On January 22, 2026, Insung spent the entire day lying in bed at home due to a hangover.

On January 24, 2026, Insung decided to change his lifestyle to focus on academic improvement. He identified several requirements for this goal: implementing a macro to reserve a study room two days in advance, confirming his weekly schedule, and tracking his food consumption and budget. He also committed to writing study notes. Insung planned to stay in the Seonjeon area on weekends to study but also wanted to focus on socializing during that time. He expressed a specific interest in visiting gay bars on weekends and learning how to drink alcohol properly, noting that he had not been meeting people recently.
