The content is a chat log between two individuals named Insung and Soo.

Insung admits to being extremely lazy recently and describes himself as feeling exhausted. He mentions that he has done nothing all day so far.

Soo reports that he just woke up after sleeping in. He informs Insung that he failed something referred to as qsa but expresses that he is fine with the outcome.

Insung and Soo discuss a message Soo received regarding the qsa failure. Soo considers whether or not to reply, and Insung suggests either not replying or simply leaving a heart reaction.

Soo mentions that one of his classes for the day was canceled. He plans to wash up, get ready, and meet a mentor in the evening.

Both Insung and Soo reflect on their current lifestyle and express a desire to live a more productive life, referred to as a God-life. Insung plans to go to a cafe he frequently visits to be productive. He invites Soo to join him. They agree to meet at a train station around 1:00 PM.

Soo shares that he received a text message from a man he met the previous day. The man told Soo that he left a bag of Doritos behind. Soo explains that the man had bought the Doritos for him. Insung finds the situation humorous and refers to it as Doritos and chill or Doritos flirting.

Soo describes the man as being 184cm tall. He notes that the man showed him a dinosaur doll named Harry that the man brought from England. Soo describes this behavior as a bit like infantilism but finds it cute. Insung also finds the story about the doll very cute.

Soo details the encounter from the previous night, stating that the man wanted to have sex. Soo says the man asked for consent approximately every minute. Soo told the man that he only has sex with a romantic partner. In response, the man asked if he could hold Soo's hand instead. Because Soo did not give consent for sex, they just hung out or chilled.

Soo considers asking the man if he is bisexual. Insung advises Soo that most people are straight and suggests that contacting him further might not be a good idea. Soo sends a reply to the man telling him to eat the Doritos himself and to be good to the dinosaur doll, Harry.

Insung expresses that he would like to have a straight male friend with a similar vibe. Soo offers to introduce them, but they speculate that the man might avoid Soo now regardless of whether or not they had sex.
