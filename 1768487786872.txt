The file name is 2025-10-10.md. The events described occurred on Friday, October 10, 2025. Insung had an extremely busy day starting with an urgently scheduled counseling session in the morning. During this session, Insung met a new counselor named Stephanie. Stephanie suggested that Insung’s condition was a normal reaction to the stress of adapting to a new environment, but Insung disagrees with this reasoning, believing that if adaptation were the issue, the mental breakdown would have happened much sooner. 

Insung reports feeling severely depressed and anxious. Since the previous Wednesday, Insung has been unable to do anything and has been consumed by constant thoughts of death. Insung has also been unable to sleep. Despite these symptoms, Insung initially believed that because emotions fluctuate in patterns, a formal diagnosis of depression or anxiety disorder and subsequent medication were unnecessary. 

During the counseling session, Insung was visibly distressed, shaking, nearly crying, and unable to lift his head due to intense emotions or exhaustion. Stephanie determined that Insung needed medical treatment at a hospital. She provided Insung with a reference letter but sealed it so Insung could not read it, fearing the contents might cause him shock.

Insung visited the University Health Services (UHS) and described his symptoms and their frequency to a doctor. The UHS doctor encouraged Insung not to be overly anxious about being in a mentally unhealthy state. However, the UHS doctor referred Insung to a larger psychiatric clinic for a more precise diagnosis, which led Insung to believe his condition is serious.

Insung was prescribed two medications. The first is Prozac, an antidepressant taken in the morning. Insung noted that it takes about two weeks or at least a few days to show effects and reported no immediate change after the first dose. The second is Lorazepam, an anti-anxiety medication taken at night. Insung noted that Lorazepam causes drowsiness and seems to be effective. 

After taking the medication, Insung went for a walk at night. While he still experienced the specific anxiety that others might harm him, he found he could distance himself from that anxiety more easily. Insung was able to sleep well after taking the medication. Insung intends to seek a more accurate diagnosis as recommended.
