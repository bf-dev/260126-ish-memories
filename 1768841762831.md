Insung is documenting academic notes regarding literature, health, and economics.

In the analysis of the play The Crucible, Insung identifies guilt as a central theme where characters face the consequences of their wrongdoings. John Proctor is highlighted for admitting his sins and refusing to implicate others to save himself. Reputation is noted as a vital factor for survival in Salem, dictating societal status and life-or-death outcomes. Abigail Williams is described as manipulating fear to protect her name, while John Proctor struggles with a reputation tainted by an affair. Compassion is identified through Elizabeth Proctor, who forgives her husband and encourages him to practice self-forgiveness.

Regarding health data, Insung references the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for sleep recommendations. The notes specify that teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18 need 8 to 10 hours of sleep per 24-hour period. Adults aged 18 to 60 are required to sleep 7 or more hours per night.

Insung also maintains a technical diagram created with the Excalidraw plugin, which depicts an economic model of the market for bank reserves. The diagram contains several text elements and lines representing supply and demand. The x-axis is labeled as the Quantity of Reserves. The y-axis represents interest rates, featuring an Upper Bound and a Lower Bound. The diagram identifies a Policy Rate, which is clarified as a target rate rather than a nominal interest rate. 

The graph shows a demand curve for reserves labeled Dr and two supply lines for reserves labeled Sr and Sr2. A horizontal line in the diagram indicates a section where the interest rate does not change despite a shift in the supply of reserves from Sr to Sr2. An arrow in the drawing indicates a rightward shift in the supply of reserves.
