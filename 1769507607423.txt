Insung explains that R markdown is used for stylish texts, inline code, and results. Assignments for this course are handed out and received in R markdown format. A provided learning resource is a link to a book by Rafael A. Irizarry on reproducible projects with RStudio and R markdown.

Markdown is defined as a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It was created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. It is designed to be appealing to human readers in its source code form and is widely used for blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation, and readme files. According to the Wikipedia screenshot provided, the internet media type for Markdown is text/markdown and the Uniform Type Identifier is net.daringfireball.markdown. The initial release was March 19, 2004, and the latest release shown is version 1.0.1 from December 17, 2004.

The presentation distinguishes between three types of files in R. R Markdown files with the .Rmd extension are used for creating polished, reproducible documents like reports or tutorials; codes are executed when the file is knitted. R Notebooks are an interactive extension of R Markdown ideal for exploratory analysis, prototyping, and development; codes are executed in real-time with inline results. R Scripts with the .R extension are plain text files used to write and execute R code without additional formatting; codes are run in an R console.

Insung provides a Markdown cheatsheet including various syntax rules. Titles are created using the pound sign, where one pound sign indicates Heading 1 and up to six pound signs indicate Heading 6. Text formatting includes italics created with single asterisks or underscores and bold text created with double asterisks or underscores. Lists can be bulleted using an asterisk or ordered using numbers followed by a period. Links are formatted as bracketed text followed by the URL in parentheses. Images use the same syntax as links but are preceded by an exclamation mark. Quotes are created using the greater-than symbol. Checklists use a dash followed by a space and brackets containing either a space for an incomplete item or an x for a complete item.

The lecture includes several online resources for working with Markdown. Online editors include StackEdit, Markdown Live Preview, Dillinger, and Markable. Documentation and tutorial resources include the Markdown Guide, GitHub Markdown Guide, Obsidian Help, and Learn Markdown in Y Minutes. Collaboration tools mentioned include HackMD.

An example of Markdown usage in a Jupyter Notebook titled ColabFold: AlphaFold2 w/ MMseqs2 is shown. This example includes HTML tags like font color and image source tags. Insung instructs students to download the example file named 01.ColabFold.Rmd from Moodle and open it in R Studio to knit it. The file lists Google Brain as the author and 2021 as the year.

Specific Markdown formatting tips are provided. A split line is created using three hyphens. Line breaks in Markdown are described as counter-intuitive; to create a newline, one must add two spaces to the end of a line. However, this two-space method does not work in titles. For titles, the HTML tag <br> must be used to break the line, and a newline should follow the tag.

For list items, Insung specifies that there must be one space after the bullet or the number. For links, the syntax is text to show in brackets followed by the link in parentheses. For images, the syntax is an exclamation mark followed by brackets (empty or with a description) and then the image link in parentheses. To get an image link online, a user should right-click the image and select Copy Image Address.

The presentation includes a screenshot of a Twitter poll by Bob E. Hayes from November 25, 2015. The poll asks how to pronounce the word data. The results from 146 votes show 63% say day-tuh, 20.5% say dat-uh, and 16.4% say dah-tuh.

Quotes in Markdown may appear with a grey background or a grey bar at the front depending on the platform. Checklist syntax is very specific: for an empty box, use a dash, space, left bracket, space, right bracket, and space; for a checked box, use a dash, space, left bracket, lowercase x, right bracket, and space.

Code formatting is handled via backticks, which are found on the key to the left of the 1 key. Inline code uses single backticks. Code blocks use triple backticks. R markdown has special code block features. A block starting with triple backticks followed by {r block_name} will show both the code and the results when run. A block starting with {r block_name, echo=FALSE} will run the code and show only the results, hiding the source code.

Tables are created using pipes and hyphens. Alignment is determined by the placement of colons in the header separator: colons on the left for left-aligned, colons on both sides for center-aligned, and colons on the right for right-aligned. Insung notes that to put a space before text in a table cell, the HTML code &nbsp; (non-breaking space) should be used. The website tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables is recommended for creating tables.
