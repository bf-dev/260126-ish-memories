The conversation takes place between two individuals named Soo and Insung. Insung ate dinner and mentions that he has eaten twice today. Insung's dinner consisted of a home-cooked meal of fish. Insung states that this is the first time he has eaten a home-cooked meal in five years. Soo is currently in a warm country during the winter season where they have been swimming and eating. Soo ate fried banana and chicken earlier and noted that the fried banana was sweet. Soo was lying in bed during the conversation and had a massage scheduled for 9:00.

Soo expresses a feeling of unhappiness and misery despite having no objective reason for it, mentioning that their parents are treating them well and the food is good. Insung responds by saying that having no reason to be unhappy does not automatically mean a person is happy. Insung admits that he currently feels the same way and states that he does not feel happy lately unless he drinks alcohol. Insung suggests that Soo should look for something that truly makes them happy. Soo mentions a person named Yoo Ah-rim who used to make them happy, describing it as a past love or crush. Insung suggests networking or meeting various people, which Soo interprets as a form of casual dating or "multi-summing." Insung admits he does not actually know the method to become happy himself.

Soo describes a method for achieving "one-day happiness" which includes eating delicious food, watching interesting YouTube videos, buying something they want, and receiving comfort or attention from another person. Insung argues that it is possible to survive even when happiness is absent, mentioning that one can endure by drinking Pocari Sweat and occasionally meeting friends even if they lack the energy to eat full meals. Insung describes himself as a "failure" or "waste" (using the term pyegup) and suggests his mental state is a "brain problem" resulting from past hardships he has endured.

Soo mentions feeling a desire for "appropriate self-destruction" that does not have long-term life-ruining consequences, specifically wanting to avoid drug addiction or unwanted pregnancy. Insung admits to having practiced self-harm (cutting) in the past and notes that it helped relieve stress. Soo considers using an electronic cigarette as a form of self-destruction that is unhealthy but not immediately catastrophic. Insung shared a photo during the chat which Soo described as having a Pinterest aesthetic and Insung described as having "good vibes" (using the slang neujeot). Soo mentions feeling lonely and having intrusive thoughts because their parents went out.
