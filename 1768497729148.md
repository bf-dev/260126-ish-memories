Insung is the subject of a text conversation with an individual named Soo. On the day of the conversation, Soo informs Insung that they have been kicked out of their house and are looking for a place to stay, such as a study cafe or a hotel. Soo describes the situation as a very sad story. Insung expresses concern and suggests they meet up to do ka-gong, which refers to studying or working at a cafe, and then have dinner together.

Soo is working on college applications and tells Insung to bring a MacBook. Insung mentions that they have recently started working again and also has tasks to complete. They agree to meet at Gangnam Station. Insung initially suggests meeting at 1:00 PM or 1:30 PM but they eventually settle on 2:00 PM because Insung needs to charge their phone at home before leaving.

Soo arrives first at a location called The Novem Ber Lounge Gangnam Station KG Tower Branch, located at Seoul Gangnam-gu Yeoksam-dong 819-5. Soo requests that Insung bring a nail clipper from home because their nails are too long to type comfortably. However, Insung is already on the bus and cannot return home. Soo then asks Insung to buy a nail clipper at a Daiso or Olive Young store on the way to the lounge, offering to pay for the cafe in exchange. Soo notes that the lounge has a strange DJ playing an acoustic version of the song 7 Rings by Ariana Grande.

Later, the conversation references a second location called roomcafe hello, located at Seoul Gangnam-gu Yeoksam-dong 619-3. Soo mentions that the atmosphere there is chilly or awkward. Soo expresses feeling a reality check or disillusionment while looking at their contact list of women. Soo notes they are talking to several girls, including those born in 2007, whom Soo describes as innocent and unaware of certain dating behaviors like playing the field.

Soo and Insung discuss dating dynamics within the lesbian community. Soo shares a profile of someone who is younger, has short hair, is 166 centimeters tall, and is described as chubby, yet expects their partner to cover all expenses. Soo and Insung criticize this, with Insung stating that if someone does not pay, they should be exceptionally attractive. Soo explains that in their experience, younger short-haired women are not in high demand in the lesbian scene because most people prefer older women. Soo specifies that 20-year-olds look for 22-year-olds, and 22-year-olds look for 25-year-olds. Soo also notes that masculine-presenting women, or butches, also have a high preference for older feminine-presenting women, or femmes.

Insung mentions that they showered before arriving at the meeting location. The conversation ends with Insung mentioning the K-pop group NewJeans while discussing the psychology of dating preferences.
