Insung proposes a data collection strategy involving two primary methods: Large Language Models scanning restaurant menus and self-reported data provided directly by restaurants. A diagram illustrates this process by showing a screenshot of a restaurant menu web page featuring dishes such as Chicken Korma and Chicken Tikka Masala. An arrow directs this information into a processing unit labeled o4-mini, which is described as the fastest and more affordable reasoning model. The o4-mini model extracts structured JSON-like data from the menu. An example of this extracted data for Chicken Korma includes a list of fifteen ingredients: chicken, yogurt, cream, cashew nuts, onion, garlic, ginger, coriander, cumin, turmeric, garam masala, cardamom, cloves, oil, and salt. The potential allergens identified for this dish are dairy and tree nuts.

Insung presents a feature for personalized allergy filters and alerts. A mobile application mockup titled Select Your Allergies allows users to tap circular icons to select or deselect common allergens. The nine listed allergens are peanuts, dairy, eggs, tree nuts, shellfish, wheat, soy, fish, and sesame. A continue button at the bottom indicates that three items have been selected. The user selection is represented as an array of strings including peanuts, eggs, and shellfish. The system provides visual feedback through three stylized alert banners: an orange banner with a warning icon for Shellfish Contained, a yellow banner with a warning icon for Cross-contamination, and a blue banner with a checkmark icon indicating a status of Safe.

The business model and ordering process described by Insung include adding allergen information to reservations which is then automatically sent to restaurants. The system is designed to integrate with booking, delivery, and review platforms. Revenue is generated through affiliate links to reservation services and tools, with a commission rate ranging from 3 percent to 5 percent. The slide displays logos for DoorDash and OpenTable as examples of integrated platforms associated with this commission structure.

To enhance the idea, Insung suggests using BLE Beacon and location data to notify users of potential allergy risks as soon as they enter a restaurant. Insung also plans to incorporate calorie information and menu insights. This strategy aims to expand the target market from a niche pool of allergy-sensitive customers to a broader audience of people who are concerned about their general health. The final slide presenting these improvements consists of plain text on a black background.
