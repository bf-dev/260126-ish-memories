Insung describes a female acquaintance as an anchor who provides a steady force and keeps him grounded during turbulent new situations where he struggles with direction and mental health. Insung states that this woman is more emotionally intelligent than he is and understands his feelings better than he does. This woman encouraged Insung when he was struggling to perform basic daily tasks by checking on him every day and listening without judgment. Insung says she is a friend who remembers small details and protects the people she cares about. 

Insung and Soo discussed meeting in January. Insung initially suggested January 2, but Soo requested to meet in the afternoon or on a different day. Insung stated he was available from January 1 to January 5. They agreed to meet on January 4. Soo addressed Insung as jagiya, a term of endearment, and Insung responded affectionately with an emoji. 

Soo expressed a desire to post a Re-chin-so, which is a social media post intended to find lesbian friends. Soo mentioned that she wanted to do this because the void left by a person named Yewon was large. Soo clarified that she was looking for Twitter friends to replace the friendship of Yewon rather than seeking a romantic relationship. Soo believes that making friends online is faster than making friends in real life. 

Soo expressed hesitation about showing her face in the online post, noting it felt scary. Insung advised against posting faces online, though Soo noted her face is already visible on her Instagram account. Soo mentioned her full name is Hwang Soo-kyung and expressed embarrassment about posting a Re-chin-so on her study account because her real-life friends follow it. Soo considered changing her social media nickname. Soo stated that her life summary is that she does what she wants and often regrets it later.

Insung visited a location from his past that caused him mental distress. Looking at the building made him feel that he had not achieved anything or improved over the last four years. Soo pointed out that Insung had attended university during that time. During the conversation, Insung was drinking a Highball at a convenience store. 

Soo was listening to a new song by a Japanese band she likes and shared the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lfv6MSHk7Q. Soo felt the lyrics, which mention feeling like a pathogen and wanting to become someone worthy of another person, reflected their own situation. Insung agreed, stating he often feels like a pathogen who causes trouble for others when he is struggling. Soo suggested that interpreting the "you" in the song lyrics as oneself rather than another person provides comfort. 

On Wednesday, December 31, 2025, Soo celebrated that she had not died and had not become pregnant during the year. Insung confirmed that he also did not die in 2025. Soo joked that if Insung had become pregnant, he would have become a billionaire. Soo eventually posted a Twitter friend recruitment post but expressed regret regarding the photo she selected for it.
