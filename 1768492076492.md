The content is a text message dialogue between two individuals named Soo and Insung. The conversation focuses on infidelity, relationship structures, social norms, and personal values.

Insung expresses the view that some people may have lost their moral sensitivity regarding infidelity. He notes that while cheating is not necessarily common, it is also not rare. He mentions that infidelity occurs frequently among gay and bisexual men.

Soo shares her personal perspective on cheating, stating that she is unlikely to cheat not necessarily out of a sense of loyalty, but because she finds the effort required to find a sufficiently attractive partner to be a hassle. She refers to this as having a people-dislike disease. Insung counters that if she finds such efforts troublesome, she might not want to date at all, though Soo clarifies she wants the experience of having a primary partner.

Insung and Soo discuss the difference between labels and commitment in relationships. Insung argues that labels like being in a relationship are often lighter and less significant than actual commitment. He suggests that while the ideal is for a couple to be exclusive, in reality, people often involve themselves sexually with others even when a label exists. Soo disagrees, defining a label as an official commitment where two people belong to each other exclusively.

Soo identifies as someone who pursues a one-and-only monogamous relationship. While she respects the concept of open relationships, she has no desire to participate in one. She states that if a partner proposed an open relationship after they had already started dating, she would break up with them immediately. Insung agrees that such a proposal would cause his feelings to cool. Soo mentions a friend who had a similar experience and ended their relationship after an open relationship was proposed. Insung suggests he might prefer a friends with benefits arrangement over a complicated open relationship proposal.

The conversation shifts to health risks. Soo expresses a prejudice that people in open relationships are more likely to contract sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Insung acknowledges the risk but states he does not see a reason to live in fear of STDs, noting that most are treatable with the exception of HIV/AIDS. He characterizes himself as being lighter in his approach to relationships compared to Soo, whom he describes as being on the heavier or more serious side.

Soo explains that she wants to live her life generally in a heavy or serious manner. She admits she does not have the mental strength to live happily outside the boundaries of social normality because society lacks support for those who deviate from it. Insung initially interprets normality as the traditional Korean expectation of a woman marrying a man and living off his income. Soo finds this suggestion offensive and clarifies her definition of normality.

Soo defines her ideal normality as a Canadian-style or Western-style normality. This involves being part of a cisgender queer couple that is legally married and practices monogamy. She describes this as living a cute life within a recognized structure. Insung apologizes for bringing up old-fashioned Korean standards of normality.

The conversation concludes with Insung stating that he believes non-monogamous lifestyles are unsustainable in the long term and become unattractive or pitiful as one grows older.
