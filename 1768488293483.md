Fact Record of Dialogue between Insung and Soo

The conversation takes place on Wednesday, October 29, 2025. The participants are Insung and Soo, whose full name is indicated as Sukyeong in the records.

Insung expresses a sense of uncertainty and requests that Soo inform him if he ever makes a mistake or does something wrong. He explains that he feels anxious if he does not ask directly for feedback. Insung states that his sense of self is currently broken or damaged. He expresses a significant fear of the future because he has many regrets regarding past decisions. 

Insung discusses his identity and how he is perceived by others. He believes he exists somewhere in a middle ground and seeks objective opinions from others regarding how he is recognized. He expresses a specific fear of a situation where he might pre-determine a conclusion that he is gay and then force his actions to follow that label. 

Soo identifies as bisexual and has spent significant time reflecting on this identity. Soo states a dislike for being bisexual. Soo clarifies that they like women and generally do not like heterosexual men, but finds certain attractive men appealing. Soo describes their identity as being too heterosexual to be gay and too gay to be heterosexual, calling it a queer identity that lacks queer-ness. 

Soo notes that they are perceived by society as a heterosexual Asian woman. Soo believes that because they do not outwardly deviate from social normalcy, especially while in Asia, their queer identity feels insufficient. Soo expresses a desire to belong somewhere but finds it difficult to accept themselves as they are. 

Soo shares a personal fear of distancing from people without a clear reason. Soo promises to tell Insung if they are ever disappointed in him and asks Insung to do the same for them. Soo believes that individuals should establish the framework of their self-identity in their 20s and expresses fear that every current action shapes their future self.

The conversation touches upon the queer culture in Hong Kong. Soo describes the Hong Kong gay scene as a place of dual pressure: the pressure to remain respectable enough to be accepted by society while also the pressure to participate in nightlife and hookup culture to be considered truly queer by the community. Soo characterizes these one-time relationships as being driven by dopamine and temporary relief from loneliness rather than a deep understanding of a person's fundamental pain or life. Soo believes people in the Hong Kong queer community may fall into shallow relationships because there is no one to understand their core wounds.

Insung mentions that he is currently in a new environment and has a desire to experience many things, but he finds no healing or comfort in temporary or light connections. He feels that this phase of lightness has ended for him. 

Soo admits that even if someone were to approach them with genuine vulnerability or a serious proposal for a relationship, they would likely run away or reject it at this time, regardless of how much they like the person.
