The chat occurs between two individuals named Soo and Insung. The date recorded in the message log is Tuesday, January 13, 2026.

Soo is considering how to tell a girl that they want to get closer while feeling that withholding certain information would be unfair to her. Insung questions the appropriateness of having this conversation in person. Soo finds the girl fun and notes that she does not appear to have mental health issues. Insung observes that Soo has been stressed with applications recently but seems to be enjoying going out more as the process concludes.

Soo expresses doubt about their current behavior and questions if their actions are right. Insung suggests that meeting the girl to give her hope only to take it away might be wrong, but eventually tells Soo to meet her if they really want to. Soo reflects on whether they are using the girl to boost their own self-esteem. Soo mentions a person named Jang Ye-won, stating they have been acting out or struggling since their involvement with her.

Insung mentions that he has lived with very little psychological dependence and cannot fully relate to the feeling of losing someone. He believes that a person needs to be stable themselves to have a satisfying relationship.

Soo discovers that the girl they are interested in was born in 2008. Soo is distressed by this information because she is a high school senior, even though she has dropped out of school. Soo decides that the age gap is too large and that they cannot proudly introduce her as a girlfriend to friends. Soo begins writing a long message to her, stating she is a good person but they should just be friends so as not to take up her time during an important period of her life.

Soo admits that their desire for a relationship stems from wanting a companion to spend time with while on a leave of absence in Korea. Soo specifically wants someone they find attractive to hang out with "legally." Soo confirms they will likely take a leave of absence from their studies.

Insung claims his own life situation is more problematic than Soo's to offer some form of comfort. Soo expresses a strong need for the intimacy or validation that comes with a relationship.

On the night of the chat, Insung was at a party room and planned to stay up all night. Insung attempted to call Soo via voice talk, but Soo missed the call while preparing to shower. Soo intended to stay up all night as well but fell asleep. The next morning, Soo attended a Pilates session and expressed a need to focus intensely on finishing applications. Insung confirmed that he successfully stayed up all night.
