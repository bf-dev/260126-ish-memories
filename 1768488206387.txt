The conversation is a text message exchange between two individuals named Soo and Insung. The dialogue covers topics including the Korea Queer Parade, dating app experiences, gender identity, and personal preferences.

Regarding the Korea Queer Parade, Soo regrets not attending a specific parade, likely the 2023 Korea Queer Parade. Soo mentions that the event is fun and notes that Korea is the only country where she has attended a Queer Parade. She mentions a specific participant who dressed as a Gay Jesus and was reportedly criticized by Korean Protestants. Insung initially questions if the photos are from Korea because they do not look like a typical Korean setting.

Regarding dating apps, Soo shares an experience with a man on Tinder who asked if she was mixed. When Soo replied that she is fully Korean, the man responded with the pick-up line "half mine half fine." Soo finds these types of simple or cheesy jokes amusing, including the line "Are you from Tennessee? Because you are the only ten I see." While she finds these jokes funny, she notes she would not date someone like that seriously.

Soo describes her ideal type as someone whose brain muscles went to their abdominal muscles, implying she likes people who are physically fit but perhaps simple or cute in a "dumb" way. She agrees with Insung's description of her wanting an alpha woman. In contrast, Insung states he prefers intellectual people and likes British accents. Insung also mentions an interest in people who perform chemistry experiments.

Soo expresses frustration with Tinder's interface. She has her settings set to see women and non-binary people (other), but men frequently appear in her feed, possibly by identifying as "other" or "they/them." Soo prefers Bumble because it filters based on both her orientation and the orientation of others, whereas Tinder requires more manual filtering. Soo's Bumble bio was "be gay do crime," and her Tinder bio was "u can gaslight me if ur hot."

Regarding gender identity, Insung identifies with "he/they" pronouns and views this as an attainable identity or aesthetic goal. He mentions that many of his Instagram mutuals use "he/they" pronouns. He also references a conversation from a previous Thursday involving himself and a person named Sukyeong, where he mentioned meeting a "he/they" person during a counseling session. Soo and Insung briefly discuss the distinction between gender as an identity versus a performance or an aesthetic pursuit.

At the time of the conversation, Soo is in Hong Kong. She is currently taking a taxi to the airport because her suitcase is too heavy to carry. She shares a photo of the "Hong Kong vibe." Insung is preparing to go to sleep and mentions that he can sleep easily after taking his evening medication.

Soo mentions a plan to print phrases like "be gay do crime" on black T-shirts. Insung expresses concern about wearing such shirts in public. Soo responds that she wants to wear "gay T-shirts" specifically to attract the attention of pretty women.
