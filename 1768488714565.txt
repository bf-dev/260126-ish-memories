Insung and Soo are the participants in this conversation. Insung told Soo to sleep well and later exchanged greetings with her during lunch time. Insung recently watched a video about ice hockey for the first time and found the sport interesting. He plans to watch a series titled Heated Rivalry in the future. Insung has an upcoming flight scheduled for 6:00 AM. Because the last bus to the airport departs at 12:30 AM and he has tasks to process at the airport that require him to be there three hours early, he will be at the airport for a total of seven hours. He plans to spend at least three hours in an airport lounge. Soo suggested he spend his time looking at duty-free shops for two hours, eating for one hour, watching a movie for two hours, and relaxing for two hours.

Insung recently watched the movie Zootopia and discussed its social messages. He interpreted certain elements of the film as metaphors for Chinese immigrants who built California and the experiences of Native Americans. Insung finds the character Nick from Zootopia to be very sexy. Insung and Soo discussed their preferences in men. Soo expressed an attraction to men with mental health issues or unstable personalities when viewing them through a screen, though she prefers a stable partner in reality. Insung identified himself as a menhera-nam, meaning a mentally unstable man, and noted that he has been hurt by such men in the past. Insung stated that he feels very gay lately and does not want to date anyone in the year 2025. He believes he needs a stable partner.

Insung has finished his exams and is currently looking for productive activities. His plans for his free time include exercising, watching Netflix, watching a drama about dating an ice hockey player from an opposing team, buying clothes, and trying the Korean alcohol Chamisul for the first time. 

Soo is going ice skating the day after this conversation. She mentioned that her friend Arim used to be an ice hockey captain, which is why Soo has watched the sport frequently. Soo watched Zootopia with her parents and is considering a second viewing. Soo plans to meet a person named Jang Ye-won during the upcoming winter break. Soo noted that Jang Ye-won usually creates a document to plan their meetings. Although Soo mentioned that she has been traumatized by past incidents with Jang Ye-won and they have had intense arguments, she still wants to maintain the relationship because she values that Jang Ye-won spends time and emotional energy on her. Insung advised Soo that since she chose not to cut ties with Jang Ye-won, she should focus on building a healthy relationship. Insung described Soo as a healthy person who can take responsibility for her own choices in relationships.
