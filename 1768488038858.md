The date of the record is July 5, 2025. After waking up, Insung did not do anything in particular before preparing to go out. Insung received a KakaoTalk message informing him that the departure time was 11:10 AM. The destination was Munsan, accompanied by his aunt and his aunt's family. The purpose of the trip involved a promotion at Munsan Jayu Market where spending over 15,000 KRW allows for a tour of the tunnels. For a meal, Insung ate ramen and gimbap. Insung went on the trip with Kang Ga-yeon. Insung noted that Kang Ga-yeon seemed to be going through puberty and was expressing a lot of irritation. They boarded a bus for the tour at 1:00 PM. The tour included a guide and involved crossing the civilian control line via Tongil-ro to visit the Third Tunnel. Insung observed many foreign tourists at the site. He noted that the Third Tunnel was quite deep but otherwise felt like an ordinary cave. Afterward, they visited the Dorasan Observatory. From the observatory, they could see North Korea, including Kaesong City, but photography was prohibited. Following the tour, they briefly visited the market again. Insung purchased a magnet for Kang Ga-yeon for approximately 7,000 KRW because he felt he should buy her something. After returning, Insung ate pizza bread. He then followed his aunt to buy air (gonggi) and board games, but the items were unavailable, so they returned home. Upon returning home, Insung went to sleep because he had a headache. He noted to himself that one should not lie on the bed without washing first. Insung woke up at 8:00 PM. He went to a late-night restaurant with the family and ate frozen pork belly. After returning, Insung felt he had eaten too much and had not moved enough during the day, so he went for a 30-minute run. He found the exercise difficult. Finally, Insung washed his shoes in preparation for the upcoming week.
