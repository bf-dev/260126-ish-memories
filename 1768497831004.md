Insung expresses a strong desire to lose weight and believes he will lose weight when he goes to Hong Kong. He discusses his weight loss in relation to his mental health, mentioning that his mental state causes him to eat less. He suggests that combining his own willpower with the reduced appetite caused by his mental health will result in rapid weight loss. He compares the efficiency of not eating versus purging, noting that simply not eating saves more money and time.

Insung is currently bedridden and feeling ill, describing his symptoms as similar to body aches or a physical exhaustion (momsal). He clarifies that he does not have a cold but attributes his physical state to side effects from his medication, specifically calling it antidepressant sickness. He mentions being bored while lying down.

Insung identifies as a twink and a bottom (referred to as a tum). He expresses a preference for partners who are givers, which he notes is similar to Soo's preference for partners who are butch. He admits that he does not have a good eye for judging the physical attractiveness of women. He mentions that gay men, specifically citing an individual named Andrew, are very direct and simple when expressing interest, often saying things like I like you a lot or you are so cute.

Soo is currently in Seoul and recently woke up, noting that her sleep schedule is poorly managed. She is bored and reports being in a weird position regarding a woman she recently met. This woman was introduced to Soo by a straight female friend who claims to be an ally. The friend placed them both in a group direct message on the basis that they are both lesbians and should therefore know each other.

The woman Soo is communicating with is a Korean student at Hongik University, specifically in the Sculpture department within the College of Fine Arts. Soo and Insung describe her as a typical butch with an artistic aesthetic. Her characteristics include short hair, wearing coats even in freezing weather, and having tattoos and piercings. It is unknown if she smokes. Soo describes her as having a touching or moving personality and notes that the woman has complimented Soo's beauty.

Soo and the woman have transitioned to using informal language (banmal). Soo has agreed to meet her in person but expresses concern because she feels her Instagram profile is a lowkey catfish. Soo is uncertain whether the woman’s intentions are merely friendly or represent romantic interest. Soo explains that she likes butch women because they tend to be givers who enjoy doing things for their partners. Soo jokes that it would be a loss for lesbian culture if a woman with such a typical butch aesthetic were only interested in platonic relationships.
