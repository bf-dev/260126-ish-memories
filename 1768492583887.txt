Insung expresses the view that justifications for evil or moral wrongdoing based on the Law of Nature are often flawed and self-serving. 

Insung states that individuals frequently change moral principles to suit their own desires, using the Law of Nature as an excuse for actions that contradict its true intent.

Insung identifies Christianity as an example of a group that may argue morally bad actions are justified by a higher moral law or God, even when such actions violate common principles of justice and established laws.

Insung describes the application of moral law as subjective and biased when it is used to violate commonly felt moral truths.

Insung notes that while people may use a distorted understanding of the Law of Nature to justify evil actions, these justifications should not be marginalized because the absolute Law of Nature is unknown.

Insung analyzes the hypothesis of moral law being an instinct, noting that if it were an instinct, human behavior in conflicting situations would depend entirely on which instinct was stronger at the moment.

Insung provides a specific scenario involving the conflict between the instinct to help someone in danger and the instinct for self-preservation.

Insung suggests that without a higher standard like the Law of Nature, human responses to such conflicts would be inconsistent, unpredictable, complex, and difficult to assess.

Insung defines the moral law as a force that urges individuals to do the right thing even when it conflicts with immediate desires or instincts.

Insung argues that the moral law provides a more stable and accurate measure of ethical behavior than instinct alone.

Insung asserts that moral law is purely a product of social convention and upbringing.

Insung claims that interpretations of morality vary because moral frameworks are relative and subject to change based on social norms and cultures.

Insung notes that actions considered wrong in one time period or culture may be considered right in another, which blurs the idea of a universal moral framework.

Insung cites slavery and gender discrimination as specific examples of practices that were once socially acceptable and enshrined in law but are now viewed as outdated social norms.

Insung suggests that cultural relativism and shifting social norms could be used to deny the existence of an absolute and universal moral law.

Insung concludes that while a moral law rooted in something immutable could provide a consistent framework, it is not a plausible concept because human beings do not have and cannot acquire absolute knowledge.

Insung poses the central question of why the Moral Law cannot be classified as one of our instincts.
