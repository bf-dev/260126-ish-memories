The conversation involves two individuals named Soo and Insung.

Insung is a Computer Science major who attends the University of Hong Kong. Insung attended an international school for two years with financial support provided by his father's company. His father's company also provided a portion of his living expenses. Insung received private tutoring for two months during his previous studies. Insung attributes his admission to the University of Hong Kong to his international school background, advice from a friend, and luck. 

Insung believes the world is not fair and feels a sense of guilt regarding his current status, believing it is not solely due to his own abilities. Insung has previously been classified as a person qualifying for support under policies for the poor. 

Insung is currently dealing with a mental illness which he describes as being more severe than Soo's. Insung is taking psychiatric medication that causes a loss of appetite as a side effect. His doctor recommended drinking Pocari Sweat as a means of survival when he cannot eat. Insung plans to eat McDonald's the next day. 

Insung is considering moving to his mother's house. He expects to interact with her for about 30 minutes a day and will have a separate room. Insung compares the level of closeness he has with his mother to the relationship he shares with Soo. Insung and Soo have spent entire days together in the past. 

Insung advises Soo on using Claude rather than ChatGPT for academic work to avoid AI detection. Insung also advises Soo to be cautious about what he discloses to a psychiatrist to avoid being over-medicated. Insung refers to Soo as his little precious twink.

Soo is currently a student taking a classic literature course titled CLIT1010. Soo has an assignment for CLIT1010 due the day after the conversation that has not been started. Soo plans to visit a hospital or psychiatrist the following day. 

Soo acknowledges that his academic background, including international school attendance, IB exams, extracurricular activities, and university admissions, was heavily supported by money, tutoring, academies, and consulting services. 

Soo is eating Nude Pepero during the conversation. Soo mentioned wanting a relationship approximately one week prior to the conversation and previously had an interest in a Russian man. A person named Jang contacted Soo on the day of the conversation, but Soo felt no emotional response. Soo currently feels he has given up on the idea of dating.
