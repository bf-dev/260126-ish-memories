The document titled COMP1110 Computing and Data Science in Everyday Life covers course information and was presented on 2026-01-20. The primary instructor, referred to as Insung, is also known as Chi-Man Liu or CX. Insung is a new lecturer with over 10 years of experience as a software engineer and research assistant in bioinformatics. His office is located in CB-316, and his email is imcx@hku.hk. Insung holds consultation hours on Thursdays from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm in CB-316 or by appointment via email.

The second instructor is Loretta Choi, a senior lecturer. Her office is in CB-322, and her email is ykchoi@cs.hku.hk. There are eight teaching assistants for the course: Xuelin Chen, Jolly Cheng, Xuebo Ji, Kelvin Lam, Tim Lai, Manwen Liao, Ye Tian, and Zerong Xie. Teaching assistant consultation hours are to be announced on Moodle during the first week of class.

The course COMP1110 is designed to clarify the scope of Computing and Data Science for students, particularly those in their first to final years who may only associate Computer Science with programming, apps, GPT, Bitcoin, or hacking. It aims to explain the broader spectrum of Computer Science, school course offerings, and how to plan a three-year course of study.

There are four Course Learning Outcomes. CLO 1 involves foundational understanding of how computing, data science, and AI impact daily life, including benefits, limitations, and societal implications. CLO 2 involves practical problem-solving using computational and data analysis techniques like simple algorithms and data visualization through projects. CLO 3 focuses on collaborative innovation, requiring students to work in teams to design data-driven solutions. CLO 4 covers ethical awareness, requiring students to identify challenges such as privacy and bias.

The prerequisite for the course is basic Python programming, either by currently taking or having completed COMP1117 or an equivalent. Lectures are held on Tuesdays from 3:00 pm to 3:50 pm and Thursdays from 5:00 pm to 6:50 pm. Both lecture sessions take place in CPD-LG.01 Grand Hall. The lecture schedule is subject to change, and updates will be posted on Moodle.

Tutorials consist of one 50-minute session per week starting in the third week of the semester. There are eight time slots available. Enrollment for tutorials begins in the second week, and the slots will be announced then. Students are required to attend the same tutorial time slot every week.

The course content introduces specific fields in computing and data science through individual lectures, including guest lectures by professors. The fields include AI, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Algorithms, Theory of Computing, Bioinformatics, Cybersecurity, Cryptography, Computer Graphics, Computer Animation, Computer Vision, Data Science, FinTech, Metaverse, Human-Computer Interaction, Robotics, Networking, Databases, Distributed Systems, Programming, and Technologies for web, mobile, and games.

Assessment for the course is based 100 percent on continuous assessment with no final exam and no assignments. The continuous assessment consists of a group project worth 90 percent and an in-class quiz worth 10 percent. Group project details will be provided in February. A requirement for the project is that groupmates must be enrolled in the same tutorial slot.

The policy on plagiarism defines it as using another person's work without due acknowledgement, regardless of intent or publication status. A link for more information is provided: https://intraweb.hku.hk/reserved_1/tlearn/plagiarism/Policy-on-Student-Plagiarism-in-UG-and-TPG.pdf. Penalties for a first attempt at plagiarism include a written warning and a zero mark for the specific assignment or test, with an appeal period of one week to the Programme Director. Subsequent attempts result in the case being referred to the Programme Director and potentially the University Disciplinary Committee. Possible penalties for repeat offenses include a published reprimand, suspension of study, fines, or expulsion. Both the student copying and the student providing the work for copying are subject to penalties.

Regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI is permitted if students clearly state the name and version of the tool used along with the prompts used. Students are encouraged to ask instructors or TAs if they have doubts. Good use of AI is defined as asking the AI, reviewing the answer, thinking about it, and performing a sanity check. Bad use of AI is defined as copying the answer directly without review or understanding.
