Insung is a participant in a text conversation with an individual named Soo, who is also referred to as Sukyoung. The conversation involves planning a meeting and discussing Soo's personal life.

Soo expresses frustration over having an unproductive day and jokingly makes puns regarding the word gay. Insung suggests that Soo should live a god saeng, meaning a productive or exemplary life, starting the next day. Soo briefly mentions the idea of finding a sex partner due to mental distress but clarifies it was just random talk.

Soo attributes recent personal issues to an individual named Jang Ye-won. Jang Ye-won is described by Soo as a local woman from Busan. Soo mentions she is a voter for candidate number two, referring to her political leaning, and calls her sexy. Insung states that he respects all thoughts and opinions.

Insung and Soo plan to meet for a date. They decide to meet on Friday because Soo intends to work on Thursday to make up for an unproductive Wednesday. Insung expresses support for Soo's work goals.

The conversation references a contact girl born in 2007. Soo previously thought she was born in 2008. Soo discusses the nature of their interactions and questions if they are being a slut, which they jokingly label as part of gay culture. Soo refers to Insung as my gay and claims to only be friends with cute gays. Insung jokes that he might be more of a slut than Soo.

Insung and Soo discuss a potential itinerary for their meeting. They consider visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace and a cafe. Soo provides two specific options via Naver Maps links. The first is ZEYA, located at Seoul Jongno-gu Gwancheol-dong 45-8, which would involve a Cheonggyecheon and Euljiro course. The second is Terrace KUKKA, located at Seoul Jongno-gu Sagan-dong 126-3, which is part of a Gyeongbokgung course. Insung chooses the second option, Terrace KUKKA.

Other activities discussed include going to a karaoke room and visiting the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA), which is located next to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Insung notes that admission to the museum is free for those under 24 years of age.

There is a brief confusion regarding museum exhibits. Soo mentions seeing old cars, Hanboks, and 1988 Olympic posters at a museum they previously visited. Insung corrects Soo, stating that those exhibits are actually at the National Museum of Korean Contemporary History (History Museum), not the MMCA. Both Insung and Soo have visited the History Museum before and noted that the content remains the same over time.

The conversation ends with Soo expressing a general feeling of distress about their life situation.
