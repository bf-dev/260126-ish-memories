The individual referred to as the subject is Insung.

Insung is currently in South Korea but considers Hong Kong to be his home. He expressed a strong desire to go back to Hong Kong because he finds his current situation tiring, crowded, and cold. He traveled to Korea by airplane and feels he should be eating authentic local Korean food, though he is having trouble finding a good place to eat.

Insung is currently in Yeouido. He had originally planned to go to Seongsu-dong, but he decided against it because he realized the journey would be too difficult or tiring. When he visits the Gangnam area, he typically walks from Apgujeong to Gangnam Station, a route he used to walk frequently when he lived in Korea.

Insung is currently watching a Netflix drama about an autistic doctor. He describes it as being similar to the show Extraordinary Attorney Woo. He mentions that he likes to keep it playing in the background while doing other things.

Insung was supposed to meet a person named Soo, but the meeting did not happen because Soo's mother told her to stay home with the family. Soo is currently at home with her mother, her aunt, and a female cousin who is one year older than her. Soo describes the atmosphere as awkward and says the family expects her to tell stories about her time in Hong Kong. Soo's family planned to order Yoajung (a yogurt ice cream brand).

Insung and Soo are planning to see the musical King Boots (likely Kinky Boots) tomorrow. Soo is looking into the ticket prices and found them to be more expensive than expected. Insung mentioned that he can just barely afford an A-class seat. Soo suggested they should try for R-class or S-class seats to have a better view and offered to ask her father for a discount. Insung mentioned that there are free coupons or tickets available for individuals born in 2006, though the context suggests they might be looking at paid options now.

Soo is planning to go to a hair salon tomorrow and asked Insung for advice on whether she should dye her hair. Insung has experience with bleaching his hair and warned Soo that his hair became very thin and brittle, feeling like plastic or husks. He advised her that while bleaching looks good, it is only okay to do if her hair is not already thin.

Regarding the weather, Insung noted that it is quite cold outside but hot inside buildings due to the heating. He admitted that he did not dress warmly enough for the outdoor temperature.

Soo recommended that if Insung goes to Seongsu-dong, he should try the strawberry glutinous rice cakes (strawberry mochi) and mentioned there is a good bone hangover soup (byeo-haejang-guk) restaurant there.

During their conversation, Soo mentioned she was writing in her diary and checking her email. She also shared a story she was reading about a man who cheated on his partner of five years after a one-night stand. Insung responded that he has become desensitized to such stories.
