Lec02-R programming.pdf contains 79 pages of lecture slides for the course Introduction to Data Science and Engineering. Insung, also referred to as RB Luo or 羅銳邦, is the primary presenter of the materials, which include contributions from Rafael A. Irizarry and modifications by Michael Wu. The course is associated with the School of Computing and Data Science at the University of Hong Kong.

Insung describes R programming as having two sides: it is easy to learn but difficult to master. Visual metaphors include meme images comparing R's data type simplicity to C, C#, and Java, and the learning curve compared to a person tripping over a rake versus a person performing complex skateboard maneuvers. Insung explains that R was developed by statisticians as an interactive environment for data analysis rather than by software engineers for development. Key strengths include its interactivity for data exploration, its script-based reproducibility, and its power in data visualization. R is free, open-source, and runs on Windows, MacOS, and UNIX/Linux platforms. It features an active community and easy-to-add-on packages for various domains like finance, ecology, and biology.

Despite R's power, Insung notes that MS Excel remains widely used, as shown in a data scientist starter pack meme. Insung uses RStudio as the primary Integrated Development Environment. The RStudio interface consists of four main panes: the Script editor for creating and editing code, the Console for interactive R code execution, the Environment/History pane for inspecting objects, and the Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer pane for visualization and documentation. Insung provides keyboard shortcuts for RStudio, such as Ctrl+Shift+N or Cmd+Shift+N to create a new script. The lecture mentions R version 4.5.1 for installation links, though screenshots show version 4.2.2. Installation files for Mac include arm64.pkg for Apple silicon and x86_64.pkg for Intel Macs.

Insung emphasizes a mindset where data scientists should be comfortable setting up their local environments, comparing them to chefs who use their own cookware. In RStudio's global options under Tools, Insung recommends unclicking Restore .Rdata into workspace and setting Save workspace to .Rdata on exit to Never to avoid memory issues with unneeded data.

Basic operations in R involve the console and script editor. To run a line of code, the shortcuts are Ctrl+Enter on Windows or Cmd+Enter on Mac. To run a whole script, use Ctrl+Shift+Enter or Cmd+Shift+Enter. Insung demonstrates the first ritual of printing No more hello world, noting that strings require quotes. Autocompletion is triggered by the Tab key. Packages are installed using the install.packages function and loaded with library. Examples include tidyverse and dslabs. To install specific versions, the remotes package and its install_version function are used, such as installing tidyverse version 1.3.2.

R uses objects to store data. Assignment is performed using the left-arrow operator <-, which Insung recommends over the equal sign =. Variables are listed in the Environment page. Variable naming follows snake_case conventions: descriptive, all lower case, and using underscores instead of spaces. R is case-sensitive, so TRUE is a logical value but True is not. Built-in functions like ls list all objects in the workspace, while rm removes them. Mathematical functions like sqrt and log are built-in. Help for functions is accessed using help or the question mark prefix, such as ?log. Arguments can be required or optional; optional arguments have default values assigned with the equal sign.

The dslabs package contains the murders dataset, which includes 51 observations of 5 variables: state, abb, region, population, and total gun murders. The str function shows an object's structure, and head displays the first six lines. The accessor operator $ allows access to specific columns, such as murders$population.

R supports several atomic data types: numeric for float or double values, integer for whole numbers (often suffixed with L like 1L), logical for boolean values TRUE or FALSE, character for strings, and factor for categorical data. Factors store levels as integers with a label map for memory efficiency. The levels and reorder functions manage factor data. Vectors are objects with multiple entries of the same type, created using the concatenate function c. If mixed types are combined in a vector, R uses coercion to convert them to the highest-level type, such as converting numbers to characters.

Lists are special objects that can store combinations of different types. Components are extracted using $ or double square brackets [[]], which return the value. Single square brackets [] return a list containing the key and value. R indexing starts at 1. Accessing index 0 returns the data type of the object. Negative indexing, such as x[-1], excludes the specified item. Matrices are two-dimensional objects where all entries must be the same type. They are created with the matrix function and indexed using square brackets, such as mat[row, column]. Empty spots in indexing, like mat[2, ], return an entire row or column as a vector.

Sorting is handled by several functions: sort orders a vector's values, order returns the indices that would sort the vector, and rank returns the rank of each entry. Functions like max and min find extreme values, while which.max and which.min find the index of those values. Vector arithmetic in R is element-wise. Insung calculates murder rates per 100,000 people using the formula: murders$total / murders$population * 100000. This reveals that California, which has the highest total murders and largest population (37,253,956), does not have the highest murder rate.

Insung warns about recycling, where R repeats a shorter vector to match the length of a longer one during operations, often only issuing a warning rather than an error. Logical operators include & for logical and and | for logical or. Double operators like && and || only compare the first element of a vector. Logical subsetting is used to filter data, such as finding states with murder rates lower than Italy's rate of 0.71. Helper functions for indices include which to find TRUE entries, match to find positions of elements, and %in% to check if elements exist in another vector.

For basic visualization, Insung introduces the plot function for scatterplots, hist for histograms of distributions, and boxplot for showing locality and spread across groups. The tilde ~ operator is used in boxplots to represent relationships, such as rate ~ region.

The lecture concludes with a summary of R and RStudio basics, data types, data structures, and basic operations including sorting, vector arithmetic, indexing, and helper functions. There are 79 total pages in the document.
