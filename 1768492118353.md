The conversation takes place between two individuals, Soo and Insung. The dialogue covers topics ranging from political figures and social media following to personal sexual preferences and the nature of their friendship.

Soo and Insung discuss a man who follows a political figure referred to as Tucker. Soo believes this figure is deceased and that his wife manages his Instagram account. Soo suggests that if the man had followed Donald Trump, it would have been dismissed as a general interest in American politics. Insung finds the wife of this political figure to be scary-looking. They discuss the problematic nature of the man's potential views on immigrants, women, and gay people. Insung mentions that he has developed a thick skin or immunity to hearing derogatory or "rotten" comments because he hears them frequently.

Insung shares information about a recent event related to Tucker in the United States, noting that the gay dating app Grindr crashed in that specific area during the event. Soo finds the concept of a "fascist gay" or "Nazi gay" strangely attractive, specifically the idea of someone with a "pure" or "simple" brain who feels proud when agreed with. Insung and Soo joke about conspiracy theories involving Bill Gates and vaccines.

Soo expresses a sexual fantasy involving pegging and the psychological "degradation" of a male partner who eventually becomes addicted to the act. Insung remarks that heterosexual men generally do not like pegging and suggests such a fantasy might lead to the partner seeking men outside the relationship. Insung reveals that his sexual life has been "ruined" or non-existent since arriving in Korea, though he states his mental health is more important than his sex life.

Both participants express feelings of profound loneliness. Soo clarifies that this loneliness stems from a fear of not being understood by others rather than a lack of romantic partners. Insung agrees, describing his own feelings as a form of affection deficiency.

Soo mentions a friend named Ye-won who recently asked Soo how he would feel if she started dating. Soo finds this question intimidating because he and Ye-won share an intensely close friendship that includes sending video letters and communicating constantly from the moment they wake up until they go to sleep. Insung admits that he recently felt a similar sentiment regarding Soo and a Russian man Soo was interested in. Insung felt that if Soo and the Russian man became a couple, he would have to step aside and give them space. Soo reassures Insung that Insung has always been the priority over the Russian man or any other potential partner. Soo concludes by expressing a wish that neither of them gets a partner so they can continue living as single friends together.
