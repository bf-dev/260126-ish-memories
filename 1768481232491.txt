The date of the record is June 30, 2025. Insung woke up late on this morning and missed his scheduled 11:00 AM or 12:00 PM appointment for his driver's license written exam. Because he missed the reservation, he decided to perform an on-site registration at the testing center instead. At approximately 1:00 PM, Insung ate a quick meal consisting of pollack roe (myeongnan-jeot) and furikake before leaving his house.

Insung began his journey by taking the Gyeongui-Jungang Line from Geumchon Station to Digital Media City (DMC) Station. He needed physical photos for his driver's license application with the specific dimensions of 3.5 centimeters by 4.5 centimeters. Since he did not have physical copies, he used a service called Printing Box. He traveled to the Emart located near Gongdeok Station to use the Printing Box machine to 인화 (print) the photos. The machine produced a single sheet containing either 6 or 8 photos that were not pre-cut. Because he did not have a knife or scissors, Insung went inside the Emart and used a pair of scissors located next to the produce weighing scales to quickly cut the photos.

After obtaining the photos, Insung took a bus toward the driver's license examination office. To complete the final leg of the trip, he chose to use a Ttareungyi (Seoul public bike) rather than a Swing electric bike, even though he noted the prices were surprisingly the same. He experienced some difficulty navigating but eventually arrived at the examination center.

The center was very crowded. Insung attempted to submit his application on the second floor, but he was told that on-site registrations are only accepted 30 to 40 minutes before the exam time. Since he arrived early, he went to the first floor to fill out his application form and undergo a physical examination. During the health check, he marked his color vision as normal even though he has some color weakness, as he is able to distinguish red, yellow, and green. He also completed the vision test.

Before taking the written test, Insung attended a mandatory one-hour safety education session, which he described as very boring and making him feel sleepy. While there, he observed a Turkish woman who was attempting to apply for a Type 1 license but appeared to have been misinformed about the process, which caused a delay. After the education session, Insung took the computer-based written exam and passed with a score of either 92 or 93 points, well above the 60-point passing requirement.

While walking back toward the Digital Media City area after the exam, Insung received a phone call from his maternal grandmother. They planned to meet for dinner at the Ashley restaurant in the Newcore Ilsan branch. Wanting to experience the new GTX train, Insung took the Airport Railroad to Seoul Station and then took the GTX-A line to the KINTEX Station in Ilsan. From KINTEX Station, he rode an electric bike to the Newcore Ilsan department store.

During dinner at Ashley, Insung noted the difference in quality and price between a standard Ashley and an Ashley Queens, mentioning that Ashley Queens is superior. After the meal, Insung went to a swimsuit shop located within Newcore Ilsan that is owned by a friend of his maternal grandmother. The purpose was to buy a new swimsuit for his cousin, Kang Min-seo, as her previous one was no longer usable. After browsing the store for a while, Insung returned home.
