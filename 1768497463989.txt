The conversation takes place between two individuals, Soo and Insung, primarily between January 1 and January 3, 2026.

On the night of January 1, 2026, Insung is at home and advises Soo to stop monitoring a typing indicator from another person and go to sleep for the sake of mental health. They exchange New Year greetings. Soo receives a long message from an individual named Yewon. Yewon states that they felt pressure from Soo and felt they always had to soothe Soo whenever Soo was annoyed. Soo concludes that the relationship with Yewon is ending and expresses having liked Yewon significantly.

On Friday, January 2, 2026, Soo is removing makeup while Insung prepares for sleep. Insung tells Soo that he wants Soo to be happy and encourages Soo to live happily. Insung confirms he had a good New Year's Day and is fine. Soo reports being in a difficult situation after losing 400,000 KRW. This financial loss occurred because Soo made a mistake during a university application process, and the fee is non-refundable. Soo expresses fear about telling their mother about the lost money. 

Additionally, Soo mentions that an individual named Jang closed a joint account they shared. When Soo questioned this, Jang said the account was no longer needed and confirmed they did not hate Soo. Jang invited Soo to Busan, but Soo says they cannot go. Insung comforts Soo, saying that Soo can overcome these issues and that time will solve them.

On Saturday, January 3, 2026, Insung is outside in the cold. He mentions he was going to go to a club but decided to head home because of the freezing weather. Soo expresses feeling severely depressed due to the ongoing issue with Yewon. Soo notes that Yewon is currently out with friends and reflects on the reality of their relationship. Soo realizes that Yewon’s kindness and support were only available when Yewon had the energy or mood to provide it. Soo acknowledges that they can never be the exclusive object of Yewon's attention or have a place in Yewon's life, and therefore continuing the relationship is only a form of false hope.

Insung tells Soo that he wants to be the person who replaces Yewon in Soo's life. He expresses a desire to provide emotional and personal support to Soo without being toxic. Insung admits that he is concerned about whether he has the capacity or the confidence to stay by Soo's side indefinitely, but he promises to make an effort to be that person for Soo. Soo expresses deep gratitude and is touched by Insung's words.
