The conversation takes place between two individuals named Insung and Soo. The timeframe is late 2024, as the participants mention that the year 2025 is less than one month away.

Insung expresses a current desire to avoid meeting or seeing other people. Soo suggests that Insung may not have a secure attachment style. Insung mentions having a mental health struggle or personality issue that they question who could handle. Insung states that they have been feeling very gay lately and are at a loss for words regarding this realization. Soo notes that they were already aware of this.

Insung has recently finished exams and currently has nothing specific to study. Insung expresses a desire to engage in productive activities such as studying and exercising. Insung's immediate plans include watching Netflix, specifically a drama about a romance with an opposing ice hockey player, trying the alcoholic beverage Chamisul for the first time, and shopping for clothes.

Soo shares plans to meet a person named Jang Ye-won during the upcoming winter break. Soo mentions that Jang Ye-won requested the meeting and that Soo missed her. Soo describes Jang Ye-won as someone who is very sincere and dedicated, often planning their meetings by creating and sending documents. Soo believes Jang Ye-won likes being around Soo because she can be the person she wants to be in Soo's presence. Soo acknowledges that while there were past unpleasant events and conflict that caused Soo trauma, Soo still likes and needs her. 

Insung advises Soo that if someone caused trauma, they should be cut off, but ultimately supports Soo's decision to maintain the relationship. Insung believes that Soo is a healthy person who will eventually establish a healthy relationship. Insung defines a healthy person as someone who can independently decide to engage in an unhealthy relationship and take responsibility for that choice.

The conversation shifts to medical and psychological diagnoses. Soo mentions having seen a doctor for a ten-minute consultation and expresses doubt about the accuracy of the diagnosis because Soo did not disclose everything and the session was short. Soo notes that the doctor suggested moving to Hong Kong, citing that the place of treatment should be aligned with one's life. 

Insung reveals that they have been diagnosed with neurosis. However, Insung has decided to keep this information in the private domain and refuses to use the diagnosis as an excuse for their behavior or to identify as a marginalized or weak person. Insung believes they have received sufficient benefits from society and does not want to use their struggles to gain sympathy. Insung compares their own difficulties, such as anxiety over exam results or irregular eating, to people who lack food or cannot afford to apply to university. Insung outlines a personal philosophy to become a strong person, remain quiet about their strength, and give back to others. Soo counters this perspective by arguing that one's personal depression or unhappiness is valid and remains a separate issue regardless of others' more difficult circumstances.
