The conversation takes place between two individuals named Soo and Insung. 

On January 4, 2026, which is a Sunday, the two are communicating via text message. 

Soo shares a personal reflection about needing to have someone to orbit or focus on in order to feel a sense of self-worth. Soo mentions that in the past this person was Arim, and then the focus shifted to Yewon. Soo expresses difficulty letting go of Yewon because there is currently no one else to switch that focus to. 

Insung expresses empathy toward Soo's emotional struggle. 

Soo reports feeling physically ill with symptoms of a cold and a stomach ache. Soo mentions taking Tylenol, but the condition did not improve, leading to a plan to visit a doctor. Insung repeatedly checks on Soo's health and encourages resting. 

Insung shares a photo of Seoul and remarks that the city feels gay, noting that Korea seems to be developing. 

The two had originally intended to meet, but the meeting was postponed until the following day due to Soo's illness and Insung's own fatigue. They make a plan to go to Gangnam Station the next day to do an escape room. Insung describes Soo as being relatively calm and highly intelligent, though Soo disagrees with the assessment of their own intelligence. 

Insung mentions that he is currently trying to live without thinking too much. 

Insung describes his activities from the previous day, Saturday. He visited a queer-friendly bar in Sinchon and found the atmosphere very good. While at this bar, he coincidentally met a Korean person he had previously met in Hong Kong. 

Soo discusses the stress of university admissions, referring to it as an endless tragedy. Soo mentions the possibility of getting into the University of Toronto but expresses a general lack of desire to attend university. Insung agrees, stating a preference for being a wealthy person who does not have to work. 

Insung expresses interest in going on an exchange program but emphasizes the importance of having a place to return to. Insung identifies Hong Kong as his home base or the place he would return to. Soo indicates that for them, the place to return to in Asia would be Korea. 

The two engage in a philosophical discussion about the quality of life. Insung suggests that life itself is difficult but becomes okay once a person becomes numb to the hardship. Insung argues that staying alive is better than the alternative. Soo questions the meaning of living if life is defaulted to being miserable and mentions that philosophers like Schopenhauer and Seneca suggested that death or non-existence might be preferable. Insung counters by saying he wants Soo to stay alive and suggests that those who advocate for life are likely smarter than he is. 

Soo mentions feeling like a failure or trash (pyegeup) and struggles with a friend's advice to simply accept being a failure to find happiness. Insung supports the idea of accepting one's status to live more comfortably, but Soo expresses a desire to live a good life instead. 

Soo plans to stay at home and rest (lock in) for the remainder of the day before their planned outing the next day.
