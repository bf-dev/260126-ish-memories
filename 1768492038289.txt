The conversation record is dated Sunday, December 21, 2025, between individuals named Soo and Insung.

The dialogue begins with Soo discussing a specific man she encountered who works in finance or marketing. Soo describes this man as either very stupid or a woman-chaser (referred to by the slang term yeomisae). She notes with surprise that the man is a fan of the internet personality Chul-gu (referred to as chalker) while also being a woman-chaser, leading her to conclude he is an incel.

Insung and Soo discuss the nature of heterosexual men. Insung suggests that most straight men are woman-chasers. Soo argues that there are some who are not, but she believes that because she does not actively seek out men, any man who aggressively approaches her must be a woman-chaser. She posits that to date a non-woman-chaser, the woman must be the one to initiate the approach. Insung suggests that natural meetings (referred to as jaman-chu) can occur without aggressive pursuit. Soo mentions she has never experienced a natural progression from friendship to a relationship and finds the concept of feelings growing gradually to the point of a spontaneous kiss fascinating. A person named Jang Ye-won is briefly mentioned as a potential example of a natural meeting, though Soo is skeptical.

The two engage in a hypothetical balance game regarding dating preferences. Soo asks Insung if he would prefer a fascist gay partner or an activist (undong-kwon) gay partner. Insung chooses the activist, suggesting they could go on protest dates together. Soo chooses the fascist option because that person would be wealthy. Soo adds a condition that if it were a fascist butch lesbian, the person would have to be white, as she finds the idea of a person of color being a fascist ridiculous. Soo explains her dislike for the activist type, fearing they would lecture her on social revolution, capitalism, and political agendas. Insung finds the idea of such lectures interesting but acknowledges it might be tiring coming from a partner. Soo expresses that she finds the social revolution vibe exhausting because she is too busy with her own life to remain constantly angry.

The conversation shifts to Insung's personal mental state. Insung expresses feeling mental distress and exhaustion (referred to as jeong-byeong). He feels he is wasting time and cannot reach a conclusion about how he should live. He questions if it is okay to continue living his current way. He describes his current lifestyle as self-destructive and harmful in the long run, fearing that his behavior will eventually drive people away. He feels he lacks the strength to do anything. Soo advises him to focus on doing less rather than trying to do more. She specifically suggests he stop drinking alcohol and reduce his use of electronic cigarettes (vaping). Insung thanks her for the advice.

Soo informs Insung that she is returning to South Korea. Shortly after their initial exchange, she boards a plane. After arriving in Korea and taking a nap, she reconnects with Insung.

Insung informs Soo that he is going to the Gangnam Station area around 5:00 PM that day (December 21, 2025) and asks if she wants to meet. Soo expresses interest and asks if she can give him a definitive answer by 3:00 PM. Insung agrees to this timeframe.
