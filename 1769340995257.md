The document defines computer science based on a quote from GPT as the scientific study of computation, algorithms, and information.
Computer science focuses on theoretical foundations, design, and application of computational systems and software.
Computer science explores the how and why behind computers and problem solving through logic, math, and engineering.
In simpler terms, computer science involves making computers do things, understanding how they do them, and the study of theory and practice.
The document defines data science based on a quote from GPT as an interdisciplinary field that develops and applies methods for collecting, cleaning, organizing, analyzing, and communicating data.
The goal of data science is to generate insight, support decisions, and build predictive or explanatory models.
Data science integrates statistics, machine learning, computing, and domain knowledge to turn raw data into reliable, actionable information and products.
In simpler terms, data science is turning raw data into useful stories, decisions, and predictions.
Data science is becoming more important due to massive growth in data volume from sources like social media and IoT devices.
Data science is important for AI integration because a huge amount of data is needed for training good AI models.
Data science provides a competitive advantage as organizations using data-driven strategies earn more.
The document presents a formula where efficient algorithms, accurate models, powerful hardware, and smart people multiplied by no data results in no meaningful output.
Social media feeds utilize AI and machine learning for addictive content recommendation.
Social media feeds use data science for identifying trends and audience segmentation.
Social media feeds use computer vision for face recognition.
The document includes a screenshot of a mobile interface titled Photo Review showing four people smiling, with one face highlighted by a square box for face tagging.
Social media platforms use databases and distributed computing to handle billions of users without downtime.
Human-computer interaction in social media focuses on good UI and UX, including addictive infinite-scroll features.
Video games utilize computer graphics and computer animation for virtual reality and augmented reality.
Computer vision is used in video games for motion capture.
The document includes a four-panel image illustrating motion capture, showing a person in a black suit with sensors and the corresponding digital skeletal rig.
Human-computer interaction in games involves input devices.
Networking, databases, and distributed computing in games allow for multiplayer functionality and wireless controllers.
AI and machine learning in games are used for non-player character (NPC) and enemy logic.
Algorithms in games are used for procedural generation, such as the infinite worlds in Minecraft.
Maps and navigation use graph algorithms for routing.
Data science is used in maps for real-time traffic monitoring.
The document includes an image of a Google Map of the Boston and Cambridge area showing real-time traffic with green, orange, and red colored roads.
Networking is used for GPS and Wi-Fi positioning in navigation apps.
Natural language processing and AI are used for speech synthesis in voice navigation.
Computer vision is used for Google Street View 360 degree panoramas.
Fitness and healthcare utilize bioinformatics and data science for DNA analysis.
AI and machine learning in healthcare are used for disease prediction.
Computer vision is used for X-ray and CT scans and general biomedical imaging.
The document includes two side-by-side CT scan images of a human chest, with the right image showing color-coded internal organs.
Embedded systems are used in smartwatches for monitoring heart rates.
Signal processing is used to filter sensor noises in health devices.
Cybersecurity is essential in healthcare because patient data are sensitive.
The document states that computing and data science can be the key to both success and failure.
AlphaFold 2 is presented as a success story for protein structure prediction with AI.
The problem addressed by AlphaFold 2 is predicting the 3D structure of a protein from its 1D amino acid sequence.
Traditional wet lab methods for protein structure prediction were slow and could take years for a single protein.
Google's AlphaFold 2 used deep learning to predict millions of protein structures.
AlphaFold 2 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024.
The document includes an illustration of a red and green amino acid chain folding from a 1D sequence into a 3D structure.
The Ariane 5 rocket explosion in 1996 is presented as a failure case.
The European rocket deviated from its intended trajectory during launch and exploded.
The financial loss from the Ariane 5 explosion was greater than 370 million USD.
The cause of the explosion was an integer overflow in the program code.
A 64-bit floating point number was converted to a 16-bit signed integer.
A 16-bit signed integer has a maximum value of 32,767.
As the rocket velocity increased, the value exceeded 32,767, causing all calculations to fail.
The document notes that software engineering, specifically testing and code review, are important to prevent such failures.
The document contains two images of the Ariane 5 rocket, one showing it on the launchpad and another showing it exploding in a cloud of fire and smoke.
