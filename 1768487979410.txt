The date of the record is October 9, 2025. On the previous day, October 8, 2025, Insung attended several classes. The first was a Gender Studies class, which is a mandatory Common Core course. Insung’s male crush is a student in this same class. The subject of the lecture was transgender individuals. During this class, Insung saw a trans man whose appearance matches Insung’s personal aesthetic goals. Insung wants to achieve a non-binary or androgynous look so that others are confused about his gender. Insung notes that to achieve this goal, he may need to lose weight, change his styling, or undergo surgery.

Insung then attended an AI Common Core class, a course he usually does not focus on. During this period, he studied for an exam, felt anxious, and decided to book a trip to Tokyo. He reserved flights and accommodations during the class while feeling in a state of mental and physical weakness. The trip is planned to depart on a Thursday and return on a Thursday.

Afterward, Insung attended a Global CCGL class where he had to take three consecutive exams. He received 0 points on one of these exams due to a technical error. This event caused Insung to feel significantly frustrated and depressed. Following his classes, Insung ate sushi and went to sleep. He woke up briefly during the night to write a blog post and perform other tasks before going back to sleep.

On October 9, 2025, Insung attended a pre-arranged counseling session. He considered exercising but decided against it due to extreme fatigue. During the session, the counselor told Insung that his situation appeared serious and recommended that he visit a hospital. Although the typical waiting period for a follow-up appointment is three weeks, the counselor scheduled Insung’s next session for the very next day. Insung expressed deep distress over this urgency and his general mental state. Regarding his social life, Insung remains unsure if his crush reciprocates his feelings, but he expresses a hope that the person will like him eventually.
