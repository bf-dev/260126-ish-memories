Insung Social and Safety Advice:
Insung provided safety guidance to Soo regarding her meeting with a man from a dating app. He expressed concern that the man would perceive Soo’s request for "meaningless comfort" as a sexual invitation. Insung warned Soo that the man would definitely interpret the situation that way and advised her to be aware of this. Insung informed Soo that the emergency police contact number is 999. He requested that Soo provide him with hourly updates or a "broadcast" of her situation for her safety. At the start of the chat, Insung mentioned he was on his way home.

Details of Soo's Encounter (as monitored by Insung):
Soo met a man via a dating app. Initially, Soo was seeking comfort from a stranger and planned to take an Uber to flee if the situation became dangerous. The man Soo met is a student who also works in a lab at an institution referred to as Poly U. Insung noted that he knows someone else at that same institution. The man provided Soo with information regarding UK university admissions. Although Soo was initially worried about the man's intentions regarding the phrase "Netflix and chill," the man eventually stated he was tired and only wanted to talk. Soo described the man as very gentle, nice, and "cute." Soo fell asleep at the location but confirmed to Insung the next morning that no sexual activity occurred. Insung advised Soo not to contact the man again and to be satisfied with the single meeting as a one-time experience.
