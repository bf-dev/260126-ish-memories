Initially, the two debated the timing of their meeting, deciding that 3:00 PM was an awkward time for either a cafe visit or a meal. Insung suggested meeting at 2:00 PM for a late lunch, noting that he had not eaten anything yet. Soo also confirmed she had not eaten.

Regarding the location, Insung suggested the Mid-Levels for its escalators and tourist atmosphere. Soo expressed a desire for a place with a good vibe, delicious desserts, and a comfortable seating area. Insung then proposed the rooftop cafe at K11 in Tsim Sha Tsui, mentioning that while it lacks a sea view, the atmosphere is good. Soo agreed to go to Tsim Sha Tsui for late lunch and a cafe visit, followed by a potential walk along the Avenue of Stars in the evening.

The meeting point was set for Admiralty Station to accommodate transfers. Soo requested to push the meeting time to 2:30 PM because she was just starting to shower. Insung agreed, stating he was still at home. Soo ended up being late and messaged Insung while on her way. They eventually met near the escalators at Admiralty Station.

By 10:00 PM, the two had finished their outing and were heading home. Both mentioned having assignments to complete. Insung expressed an intention to stay up all night to work since he was in a good mood. Soo discovered that she did not have a weekly assignment this week, which she found surprising as she usually has one every week. She noted that her assignments typically take about 1 hour and 10 minutes.

Soo arrived home at Jockey Club 4 (Joki4). Insung was still on his way back, complaining about a steep hill and commenting that living at Jockey Club 4 would be better. Soo jokingly invited Insung to her place for a sleepover or pajama party.
