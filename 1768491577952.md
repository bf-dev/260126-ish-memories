This fact record is based on a chat transcript between two individuals, Soo (also referred to as Su-gyeong) and Insung.

The conversation takes place on a Friday evening.

Soo recently attended a medical or psychiatric consultation that lasted approximately 10 minutes. During this visit, the doctor told Soo that because Soo is planning to go to Hong Kong, pursuing treatment or receiving medication in Korea is currently meaningless. The doctor advised Soo to seek treatment and medication in Hong Kong instead, stating that treatment and life must be integrated.

Soo expresses frustration over the short duration of the consultation. Soo feels that since the doctor did not provide a specific diagnosis, Soo's past struggles might be attributed to personal failure or a lack of will rather than a legitimate illness. Soo suggests that being diagnosed as sick would be preferable because it would mean their actions were beyond their control.

Insung provides support by stating that the doctor's logic makes sense because medication requires frequent hospital visits, which would be impossible once Soo moves to Hong Kong. Insung also disputes Soo's claim of having a weak will, noting that Soo actively pursues many things.

Soo displays signs of suicidal ideation during the chat, making remarks about dying soon, being hit by a car, or returning to Jesus. Insung asks Soo to talk to him before doing anything so he can try to stop them. The two jokingly agree to a goal of natural death, referring to it as Team Natural Death Prayer.

Soo experiences a sudden episode of distress regarding physical appearance. Soo expresses a belief that they are ugly and therefore lack the value to be loved. Soo considers plastic surgery but worries that it will not solve the mental distress or guarantee they will feel pretty. 

Soo reflects on past experiences with people who showed interest, claiming those individuals only wanted to have sex rather than enter into a relationship. Soo categorizes themselves as potentially fuckable but not girlfriend material, though eventually questions if they are even fuckable. 

Insung reveals his own mental health struggles, describing his state as mental illness at a maximum level. Insung states that he has personally given up on being loved because he believes he lacks the qualification to be loved. Insung explains that by accepting this lack of qualification, he avoids feeling sad about not being loved.

Soo objects to Insung's perspective, asserting that they love Insung. Soo clarifies that this is not romantic love but questions why Insung believes love requires qualifications. 

The record indicates that Soo is preparing to move to or spend time in Hong Kong in the near future.
