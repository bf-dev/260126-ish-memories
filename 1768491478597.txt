The participants in the conversation are individuals named Soo and Insung. The recorded date for the latter portion of the dialogue is Thursday, December 11, 2025.

Soo mentions that she needs to ask her parents about something before informing Insung. Soo expresses a sense of shock or embarrassment, describing it as her brain melting, after seeing and recognizing the word cum. Insung finds it scandalous or unpleasant that Soo is familiar with the meaning of that word. 

Soo states she has done nothing all day and intends to wash up. Insung mentions he just woke up and encourages her by saying the day has not progressed very far yet. Insung plans to attend a counseling session and go sightseeing in Tsim Sha Tsui to walk and eat. Soo says it is cold at her location and she does not want to go outside.

At midnight in Insung's location, he asks Soo what she is doing. Soo is listening to music and lounging. Soo mentions she is experiencing a seasonal psychological slump or distress caused by the combination of night, winter, and being at home. Insung remarks that he lives with such mental distress as if it were a roommate.

Insung purchased a new electronic cigarette. Soo is currently undergoing a forced period of smoking cessation because she is staying with her parents and does not want to purchase a new device there. She expresses an intention to continue quitting smoking when she returns to Hong Kong.

Insung ate lamb skewers, noting he had not eaten for two days and felt very hungry. Soo ate a home-cooked steak prepared by her mother in a newly purchased air fryer. She notes the steak was cooked well-done but appreciates the effort. Insung mentions he has not eaten his own mother's home-cooked food in 8 years and plans to ask her to cook for him when he visits.

Soo reports that her father criticized her regarding her university studies. Her father told her that if she cannot do it properly, she should stop attending and drop out of the University of Hong Kong. Soo is uncertain if he is being entirely serious but suspects he might be. Soo and Insung discuss the bleakness of their prospects without a degree, mentioning options like a working holiday in Canada or starting a business.

They discuss a hypothetical scenario called a Hawaii ending, where Soo would run a hotel in Hawaii. Soo acknowledges that while this sounds like a reward, it would require her parents' money and would hinder her economic independence. Insung observes that their parents' financial support is linked to their status as their children and the parents' own reputations. He suggests that without this support, they might be high school graduates working for Coupang. 

Soo refers to herself as a capitalism princess and reflects on how long she can sustain that lifestyle. She believes she must graduate within her 20s because she considers being in that position in her 30s to be unacceptable. Soo concludes by expressing a sense of personal disappointment, feeling as though she has not achieved anything through her own independent efforts.
