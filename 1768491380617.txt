The chat log involves two individuals, Insung and Soo, with records spanning early December 2025.

On a date prior to or on Friday, December 5, 2025, Insung and Soo arranged to meet. Insung traveled to Soo's location, a journey that he noted takes a considerable amount of time. While in transit, Insung informed Soo he was at a transfer station with two stops remaining. They originally considered meeting at 6:00 PM but finalized the time for 6:20 PM. Insung suggested meeting at a shopping mall because it offered many food options. He specifically waited for Soo in front of the Uniqlo store located on the second floor of the mall.

Before meeting, Insung mentioned he might appear to lack energy and asked for Soo's understanding. He did not bring his MacBook but asked Soo to bring paper, a pen, and a charger for him. Insung agreed to Soo's suggestion of going to a cafe to study after dinner and also agreed to walk 20 minutes to a nearby beach.

During their conversations, Insung discussed a man Soo was involved with, referred to as Andrew or the Russian guy. Insung learned that Andrew had broken his MacBook and had an exam the following day. Insung commented that Andrew seemed cute and expressed sympathy for his situation. 

On Friday, December 5, 2025, Insung communicated with Soo after they had both returned home. Insung expressed that he was feeling very tired. He reviewed a text message Soo sent to Andrew, which was brief and wished him luck on his exam; Insung characterized this reply as cool and nice. Insung also shared an image or meme regarding twink speech patterns. He mentioned that listening to music has been his primary way of finding healing lately.

On Sunday, December 7, 2025, Insung was eating a Big Mac at McDonald's. He told Soo that he was forcing himself to eat it and that he currently felt that eating delicious food was a valueless activity. After Soo encouraged him to eat better to improve his mood, Insung decided he would eat something delicious the next day. Soo specifically recommended that Insung go to the IFC Mall to eat steak at a restaurant on the top floor that requires a reservation.

Throughout the logs, Insung is aware of Soo's personal and academic life, including Soo's interest in Ariana Grande, Soo's struggle to start an essay or report, and Soo's specific dating preferences regarding the power dynamics in romantic relationships.
