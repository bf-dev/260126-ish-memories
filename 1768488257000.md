Insung and Soo are discussing the events of the previous night. Insung mentions that marks on his skin were light and have already faded. Soo describes the previous night as an interesting experience but notes that Insung was extremely intoxicated. During his intoxicated state, Insung asked Soo for their Instagram handle twice. Insung admits he remembers this and explains that while he knew who Soo was, his mental processing was impaired by alcohol.

Insung describes the night as a good experience, though he admits he acted impulsively. Soo expresses that the experience was not particularly good for them and describes the atmosphere as having a define queer vibe. Insung reports that a person he met contacted him in the morning. This person sent casual daily messages and expressed a desire to meet. Insung interprets the use of various emojis as a sign that the person likes him. 

Insung left a shirt at Soo's room, which Soo promises to return later. Soo spent time meditating to find inner peace after feeling a sense of reality hit or post-event letdown. Insung is also experiencing some level of this feeling. Insung tells Soo that Soo was very passionate the previous night, though he advises Soo to think of that behavior as coming from a drunk version of themselves, like a different person.

Regarding his current schedule, Insung is doing laundry and preparing to go to an event or venue called High Table in the evening. Soo has a class at 6:00 PM and had to apply foundation to their neck three times to cover marks from the previous night.

Soo and Insung plan to go to a non-gay club this coming Friday for research or comparison purposes. Soo observes that people at gay clubs seem more outgoing and friendly compared to those at straight clubs. Soo mentions feeling intimidated by the vibe of straight women at clubs, comparing their style to the artist Kamo and joking that they look like they might hit someone with an e-cigarette. Soo notes that straight women do not kiss them at clubs, which Insung finds difficult to understand, suggesting he would kiss someone if they were attractive regardless of other factors.

Soo contacted a person named Dewan to ask about results from an app, following a message thanking him for the party, but Dewan has not replied yet. Soo mentions a friend referred to as Good-Hoo-Man who was kind enough to walk Soo to the 17th floor. 

The conversation touches on Insung's past romantic interests. Insung confirms he knew both the man he was with and another man mentioned by Soo. Insung describes his former potential romantic interest as very hot and admits he was bewitched by him. Currently, Insung is maintaining contact with a new man he met the previous night and promises to update Soo on any developments.

Soo shares an incident where a stranger at the club told Soo they looked like a power bottom. Soo had to search for the meaning of the term and felt annoyed and uncomfortable upon learning it. Insung questions if the comment might have been intended as a compliment. 

At the end of the log, Insung confirms he is still talking to the specific man he met the previous night.
