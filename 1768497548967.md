The chat log involves two individuals named Insung and Soo.

On an unspecified date prior to January 5, 2026, Soo and Insung discuss the topic of death and suicide. Soo mentions a person named Jang Ye-won and speculates that she would attend Soo's funeral unless Soo specifically forbade it in a will using harsh language. Insung questions the importance of what people say after one has died. Soo expresses a desire to keep certain things hidden from her parents. Insung asks if dying abroad would prevent a funeral or prevent people from knowing. Soo believes her parents would find out her status because they know she went abroad and would investigate if contact was lost. Insung suggests that one could pretend to start a new life or give a final notice to parents to cut ties, similar to ending a friendship. Soo claims she is not stupid and knows her parents would not simply accept such a disappearance. Insung suggests using a Working Holiday as an excuse to leave and cut contact. 

Insung expresses a desire to vanish or disappear, noting that dying is difficult. Soo expresses a wish to die due to reasons outside her responsibility, specifically mentioning being hit by a car accidentally and without pain. Insung suggests that an overdose might look like a natural death. They discuss the difficulty of choosing a method to end their lives. Insung suggests that drinking heavily might make the process easier. They eventually agree to try to think of better things and use escapism to cope.

On Monday, January 5, 2026, Insung and Soo wake up and prepare to meet. Insung initially suggests meeting in Hongdae, but Soo reminds him they agreed on Gangnam Station. They agree to meet at Gangnam Station Exit 10 at 3:30 PM. Insung mentions he lives near KINTEX. Soo tells Insung she plans to drink heavily and get intoxicated. Insung suggests going to an unlimited refill bar near Konkuk University, but Soo notes it is far, so they decide to discuss the location after meeting. Soo offers Insung a denim jacket, which he agrees to take. Insung informs Soo he is about 20 minutes away from the meeting point. Soo reports being delayed by three stops and then one stop. She mentions encountering a troublesome person, referred to as a subway villain, on her way. Soo arrives at the exit and asks Insung if he is near the Olive Young store.

On Tuesday, January 6, 2026, Insung sends a message saying he enjoyed the meeting the previous day. Soo replies later, having just woken up, and expresses concern that she may have behaved poorly while drunk. Insung assures her she did not act out but looked like she was struggling or in pain. Insung is in Jeju at this time and describes it as having a Korean countryside feel. Soo recommends he visit a place called Wiramwideu Books in Jeju.

Soo expresses deep depression and mentions that a woman she is interested in is not replying to her. Soo believes she has done all she can in that situation. Soo also mentions a conflict with her mother. Although they seemingly reconciled, Soo feels the problem is not truly resolved and describes her mother as having mental health issues. Soo reflects on whether taking a leave of absence from school would help, but concludes it will not solve her family problems. Insung suggests that ignoring family issues or becoming insensitive to them is the best way to move on. Soo expresses a desire to fix the situation and considers family counseling. Soo compares her family situation to her relationship with Jang Ye-won, noting that even though she knows deep down things will not end well, she continues to try. Insung indicates that he wants to tell her not to try, but knows she will not listen.
