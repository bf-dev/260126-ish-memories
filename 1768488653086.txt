The date of the conversation is Sunday, November 2, 2025. The participants are two individuals named Insung and Soo.

Insung and Soo discuss the use of Tinder. They debate the social and personal implications of dating individuals born in 2007. Insung expresses the opinion that dating a high school student could be acceptable as long as the topic of school is not discussed. Soo disagrees, finding the idea of being a partner to a high schooler strange.

Insung reports experiencing a severe hangover. Insung admits to drinking more alcohol after Soo left their previous gathering. Insung acknowledges having mixed alcohol with medication, a behavior that Soo identifies as dangerous and cause for significant worry. Insung promises to avoid this behavior in the future and suggests focusing on positive topics.

Insung mentions that their mental health has not been good lately. Insung spent several hours on November 2, 2025, lying down at home. Insung went on a date earlier that day but returned home immediately after dinner because they were not feeling well. Insung notes that the date was understanding of the situation.

Insung shares a photo with Soo of a location they had visited together previously, remarking on how it looks during the daytime. Insung expresses a feeling of guilt, stating they have done many things wrong to Soo and feels a responsibility to take care of Soo instead of being the one cared for.

Soo shares photos of an abandoned house they are exploring alone. Soo describes this as a new hobby for taking atmospheric or scary photos. Insung reacts by saying the photos are simply scary rather than artistic. Soo tells Insung to report it to the authorities if Soo becomes unreachable while at the abandoned house.

The two discuss unconventional attractions. Soo mentions finding the concept of being overwhelmed by a supernatural force attractive. Insung agrees that ghosts could be attractive if they have a good physical appearance. Soo recommends the song Devil in Disguise to Insung. Insung listens to the song and describes it as very good.

Insung discusses their sexual preferences, mentioning an interest in masculine women based on an image Soo shared the previous day. Insung asks Soo if this is a common preference. Insung also admits to having a slight interest in furry content.

Insung expresses concern for Soo’s well-being, specifically urging Soo to eat after Soo mentions not being hungry despite not having eaten all day. Insung deleted a message during the conversation because they felt they could not continue the dialogue effectively, but Soo encouraged Insung to leave the messages anyway.
