The record is dated October 7, 2025. Insung is a student currently attending the University of Hong Kong, where he has been for two years. Over the past two weeks, Insung has established a routine of traveling to Shenzhen almost every week. He visits Shenzhen because he feels less stressed there and can focus more on himself. Insung expresses a strong dislike for the food in Hong Kong, describing it as having no taste and making his daily life miserable.

Insung views his university life positively, primarily because it serves as an escape from his family, whom he describes in negative terms, as well as the pressures of high school and internal conflicts. He considers himself very lucky to be studying at the University of Hong Kong and believes that he might not have met the objective requirements to be there, though he acknowledges his own hard work.

Insung states that his priority is not simply living a productive life but rather completing and perfecting his own identity and self. During his first week of the semester, he explored Hong Kong and visited a gay club. This experience helped him resolve internal conflicts related to his previous obsession with normality. He realized he can live doing what he likes without worrying about the opinions of others. On his first day at the club, Insung engaged in deep kissing and physical skinship with a man he met there. While he did not necessarily like the individual, he felt positive about the fact that he was capable of having such an experience.

Insung has met other Korean students living in his dormitory. He describes them as generally kind but naive and unaware of how the world works. He notes that many of these students come from wealthy backgrounds, attended international schools, foreign language high schools, or private high schools, completed the IB curriculum, and often have Christian backgrounds. Insung feels he does not fit in with this demographic.

However, Insung has met one new friend who shares a similar situation and mindset. He considers this friend to be his best and perhaps only social option, though he is wary of the two of them becoming too psychologically dependent on one another.

Regarding his academic life, Insung is facing upcoming midterm exams for two subjects. He feels one subject will not be too difficult but identifies mathematics as a significant challenge. He is attempting to maintain a healthy mindset by telling himself he does not need to beat everyone else.

Insung's floor tutor has observed that Insung appears to be under a great deal of stress and has recommended that he seek counseling. Insung agrees that he needs counseling and acknowledges that his current mental state is not entirely healthy.
