The date of the events recorded is July 11, 2025. Insung went to a driver's license testing center to retake his road test after recovering his health. He had failed the road test at this same testing center previously. During the test, he drove Course C. He nearly failed the exam because he encountered a dilemma zone, but he ultimately passed and earned his driver's license. He decided to have his driving school handle the administrative process for the license issuance.

After returning home, Insung traveled to Ganghwado with his maternal grandmother and his aunt. The trip by car took approximately one hour. At a market in Ganghwado, they ate a type of fish called Baendaengi. Insung noted the fish had many bones that could easily get stuck in one's throat. His throat was already sore from a visit to a karaoke room two days prior, and the fish bones aggravated the pain, although he recovered quickly and enjoyed the taste of the meal.

Following the meal, the group visited a cafe called Joyang Bangjik, which is a renovated factory. Insung was highly impressed by the cafe's collection of vintage furniture and antiques. He expressed a desire to return or find similar themed cafes in the future. At the cafe, he consumed a cafe latte and bread while conversing with his family.

The return trip was delayed due to traffic congestion. Upon returning, they went to the house of Insung's aunt. They ordered chicken from the same Dong-geun-i restaurant where Insung had eaten previously. Insung drank 1.5 cans of beer. While eating, they watched a drama that Insung referred to as Gyeonu and Jignyeo. The drama features a female lead who is a high school student and a shaman. The male lead, played by actor Chu Young-woo, is a character who is fated to die soon, and his grandmother brings him to the shaman to save his life. Insung felt deeply immersed in Chu Young-woo's character because of his appearance and felt irritated by a male supporting character who frequently intervened in the story.

Later, Insung went to a house next to his uncle-in-law's office to finish drinking his beer. He noted that he was likely drunk at this time. After returning home, he watched a production titled K-Pop Demon Hunters (KPop Demon Hunters) before falling asleep. This record is based on a file named 2025-07-11.md.
