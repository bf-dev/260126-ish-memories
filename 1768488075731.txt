Subject: Insung.

Insung felt personally awkward earlier in the day but felt better after speaking with a friend for approximately one and a half hours.

Insung traveled to Seoul Station by train and then transferred to Line 3 to reach a different station to visit Starfield Mall.

The purpose of the trip to Starfield Mall was to collect a mobile ID card from an office where it had arrived.

Insung received an official admission offer from a university in Hong Kong. This was the only university Insung applied to.

Prior to receiving this offer, Insung had been waiting for responses from South Korean universities for five months.

Insung felt relief and pleasure regarding the offer but was also extremely nervous while handling the online application process because he was afraid of accidentally pressing a cancel button.

Upon receiving the news, Insung immediately called several people, and everyone he spoke to offered their congratulations.

Insung is required to transfer a college deposit of approximately 3000 Hong Kong Dollars (HK$3000).

Insung has additional tasks to complete, including applying for a dormitory and handling other administrative arrangements.

A celebratory party was held for Insung by his family members in Korea.

The family members present at the party included Insung's grandmother, Insung's aunt (referred to as a mother-in-law), Insung's uncle, and Insung's mother.

The day was described as special because it followed months of waiting and uncertainty.
