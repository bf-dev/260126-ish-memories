This transcript contains a conversation between two individuals named Insung and Soo, spanning December 16 and December 17, 2025.

Relationship and Plans:
Insung and Soo are friends who are planning to meet. They initially discuss meeting on December 24, but Soo has a commitment that day. They eventually agree to meet on December 26. Soo suggests they might see a musical together depending on ticket availability for that day or another. They also plan to go clothes shopping together once Soo returns from a trip.

Activities on December 24:
Soo is attending a party for a friend who passed their university entrance exams. The friend was accepted to Hongik University (Hong-dae) in the art department, not Hong Kong University (HKU).

Topics of Discussion:
Soo mentions a stereotype that there are many gay people in the Hongik University art department. Insung compares this to Hong Kong University (HKU) and notes that art departments in general often have a similar reputation.

Soo shares a personal anecdote about a female friend who suggested they should kiss if neither has a girlfriend by the end of the year. Insung finds the idea absurd. Soo later agrees, noting that it would be awkward since they are friends and have to see each other's faces again. Soo uses a comparison, asking Insung to imagine if the two of them did the same.

Both Insung and Soo mention having a low sex drive recently. This leads to a discussion about Seong Jae-gi and dark humor (jaegi-deu-rib). They discuss the ethics of mocking public figures and the reactions of their fans. Insung expresses the opinion that some people deserve to be mocked.

Health and Personal Status:
Insung mentions experiencing many side effects from medication. Insung notes that he has been overthinking things and discussed his decreased sex drive with GPT. Insung describes his current state as being completely out of his usual life pattern, which he finds both interesting and exhausting.

Travel and Locations:
On December 16, Insung was at the airport in the early morning. He describes the atmosphere as both good and tiring.
On December 17, Soo arrived at a travel destination. Soo sends photos of the scenery and the accommodation to Insung. Soo mentions that the cost of living at the destination is low, specifically citing a bowl of noodles that cost 2,000 KRW. Soo suggests that they should visit Bali or Thailand together in the future.
Insung is currently in Korea. He reports that it is cold there. He mentions eating a home-cooked meal of Kimchi-jjigae and other dishes prepared by his mother, which he enjoyed.

Social Media:
Soo asks Insung for his opinion on whether a specific photo is insta-worthy. They discuss whether it should be posted on a main account or a secondary account. Insung suggests that a secondary account is better to avoid random people seeing it, though he confirms the photo is good enough to post.
