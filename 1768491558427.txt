The conversation record is dated Friday, December 12, 2025, between two individuals named Soo and Insung.

The discussion begins with Soo expressing frustration about the consumption of queer culture by certain groups, likely referring to religious or conservative individuals. Soo mentions that hanging a key on one's pants is a symbol for butch lesbians, a fact Soo believes these consumers are unaware of. Insung notes the irony, stating that those groups often tell gay people to go to hell.

The two discuss the music group KATSEYE. Soo observes that some church-going individuals consume KATSEYE's music. Insung finds this contradictory to their ideologies. Insung also comments on the character Nick from the movie Zootopia, calling him sexy and cute.

Soo realizes a deadline is approaching for an assignment referred to as clit. The submission is due by noon the following day. Insung suggests sending an email to the recipient explaining the delay. Insung recommends citing depressive disorder as the cause, noting that Insung previously used this reason to resolve a missed quiz.

Insung shares that they failed a college mathematics final exam earlier that day. Insung uses this as an example to argue that grades are not the most important thing in life. Insung presents a logical chain: if grades were truly important, failing would lead to sadness, and extreme sadness would lead to death. Since Insung is still alive, Insung concludes that grades must not be that important.

Soo disagrees with this logic, arguing that one can believe grades are important and feel sad about failing without it resulting in death. Soo suggests that their cognitive operating systems are different. Insung acknowledges being quite ill but reassures Soo that they are receiving proper treatment. Insung explains that while they may have thoughts of dying, these thoughts now result in simply going home to sleep rather than actual self-harm. Insung encourages Soo to focus on finishing the essay rather than dwelling on the negative emotions of being late.

The conversation takes place late at night, around 2:00 AM. Insung advises Soo to sleep and finish the work in the morning, as Soo has a hospital appointment the next day.

Later, Soo provides an update after visiting the hospital. The doctor informed Soo that they appeared relatively fine and that their struggles seemed to be caused more by environmental factors than by a specific psychiatric disorder. The doctor suggested that if Soo wishes to seek psychiatric help, it would be better to do so in Hong Kong rather than their current location. The doctor also asked if Soo wanted medication but concluded it was likely unnecessary. Soo expresses disappointment and a sense of regret over this diagnosis, feeling that it implies their struggles are a result of personal failure rather than a treatable condition.
