The conversation takes place between two individuals named Soo and Insung. The date recorded in the transcript is Thursday, December 25, 2025.

Soo expresses deep emotional distress regarding a relationship with a person later identified as Jang Ye-won. Soo believed this person would provide continuous interest, affection, and mental stability because they promised to do so. Soo describes the relationship as a trade where the other person accepted Soo's mental health issues and anxiety in exchange for something else. Soo realizes they are much more dependent on this person than the person is on them.

Soo explains that this person helped Soo recover from three years of suffering and that Soo no longer knows how to handle difficulties without them. Now that the person is avoiding Soo, Soo feels unable to let go. Insung initially suggests that Soo should simply abandon the relationship if it causes harm, but then acknowledges that Soo likely won't. Insung notes that Soo chose to hold on because it felt like the best available option at the time.

Insung tells Soo that every person has a mental limit for what they can accept from others. Soo is upset because Jang Ye-won had previously said Soo did not need to hold back or calculate things with them. During the chat, Jang Ye-won replies to Soo's messages by completely ignoring the previous emotional context and simply stating, room cleaning complete. Insung suggests that since Soo will not cut ties with Jang Ye-won, Soo must become numb or desensitized to this behavior as it will likely continue. Insung eventually stops advising Soo to leave, stating they will support whatever choice Soo makes as their own best interest. Insung encourages Soo to sleep to avoid suicidal thoughts and overthinking.

On December 25, 2025, just after midnight, the two exchange Christmas and New Year greetings. Insung spent Christmas at home and shared photos of something described as cute. Both Insung and Soo woke up late that day. Insung mentions having a hangover from celebrations the previous day. Soo complains of severe back pain and feeling depressed. Insung mentions that they also had negative thoughts about the state of their life until they realized they had forgotten to take their medication. Insung suggests Soo should get medication when they go to Hong Kong.

The conversation shifts to Soo's academic plans. Soo is seriously considering taking a leave of absence for the second semester to stay in Korea. Soo mentions that their parents said they can do as they wish. Soo considers staying home or fleeing to Jeju Island. Insung expresses concern that taking a leave might not make Soo feel better and that Soo might spend the time regretting the decision or feeling like they haven't accomplished anything, based on Soo's past patterns. Soo argues that the second semester may be unnecessary if they are entering a new program in the September semester.
