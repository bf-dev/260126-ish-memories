He stated that he has given up on the idea of living a God-saeng, a Korean term for a highly productive and exemplary life. 

Insung admitted that he feels very tired and purposefully avoids identifying or tracking the tasks he needs to do to prevent further stress. He claims that he lacks self-consciousness or a strong ego and stated that he is fine with being a person who is not considered great. Despite his own lack of self-consciousness, he told Soo that her direction in life seemed positive.

Soo asked Insung for help with a university application that required a friend to describe her. Soo noted that she and Insung have been close and sharing experiences for at least six months. Insung agreed to help and suggested he would organize his thoughts to provide a positive, sugar-coated description for her application.

On Tuesday, December 30, 2025, Insung returned home late at night after taking the last train. He stayed awake into the early morning hours because he was unable to sleep. During this time, he talked with Soo about her decision to stop contacting an individual named Jang Ye-won. Soo reported that Jang Ye-won had belittled her by stating they were not in a dating relationship and told her to stop her current behavior. Insung identified that being treated as an inferior or being belittled is a specific emotional trigger for Soo.

During their conversations, Soo shared several personal details with Insung. She mentioned she was stressed about university admissions and had a large workload, including organizing documents, cleaning her computer, and updating her LinkedIn profile. She discussed an essay requirement of under 1500 words regarding her identity and what is important to her. Soo also told Insung about a humorous interaction with ChatGPT where the AI mischaracterized her interest in power dynamics as an academic interest in sociology or psychology, when she actually meant it in the context of BDSM. Soo also consulted Insung about whether she should delete a bikini photo from her social media feed because it was resulting in inappropriate messages from men asking for her Snapchat. Insung listened to these concerns and noted that Soo seemed to be under a lot of pressure.
