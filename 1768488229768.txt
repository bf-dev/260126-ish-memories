The chat log records conversations between two individuals, Insung and Soo (referred to as Soo-kyung in the date headers), occurring on October 12, 2025, and October 28, 2025.

On Sunday, October 12, 2025, Soo describes a friend from her past who was pansexual and very open about her identity. This friend was known for being confrontational with anyone who was hostile toward her sexuality, once telling a detractor that it was none of their business who she slept with. Soo admires this friend's spirit and describes her as a queen who was popular with girls. This friend is planning to attend university in South Korea.

Insung and Soo discuss the social environment in Hong Kong regarding queer identities. Insung believes that he is unlikely to be targeted in Hong Kong, and even if he were, the impact would be localized to him rather than affecting his entire social circle. Soo offers to help Insung "gang up" on anyone who might harass him. Insung mentions that the day of their conversation is Coming Out Day.

During the identity discussion, Soo jokingly tells Insung she is gay, and Insung expresses surprise. Insung shares that he feels calling himself bisexual (bi) feels somewhat dishonest or lacking in conscience. Soo observes that Insung never talks about women, which suggests he is unlikely to date them. Insung jokingly asks if he seems too obsessed with men. 

The two discuss the purpose of labels. Soo argues that labels are necessary for visibility and for the purpose of being recognized by society, which she views as the first step toward being integrated into social normalcy. However, she feels that once integrated, the labels themselves lose their significance and can feel limiting. Insung agrees, noting that in more progressive countries, people introduce same-sex partners naturally without having to explicitly come out as gay first.

Soo expresses a desire for a girlfriend who is tall, cool, and pretty. She mentions that while her standards are not exceptionally high, she wants a partner who will not damage her reputation when introduced to others. She specifically wants to avoid people questioning why she is dating a certain person, citing her own ego. Insung also expresses a desire for a partner.

Soo admits she has difficulty separating physical intimacy from emotions and finds it hard not to fall for a partner. She mentions a person named Arim, stating that she would have continued to like Arim even if they had been partners.

Regarding food, Soo is hungry late at night and considers going to McDonald's. Insung informs her that there is a Burger King at the airport, including one located inside the terminal. Insung mentions he ate there earlier that day but could not finish the meal because the portion was too large.

On Tuesday, October 28, 2025, Soo and Insung discuss events from the previous night. Soo wakes up and experiences a strong sense of reality check or regret (referred to as "hyunta"). Insung feels similarly but clarifies that he does not regret what happened. Soo is distressed because she has a visible hickey (kiss mark) on her neck. Since she has to go to school that day, she expresses the need for a full tube of concealer to hide the mark.
