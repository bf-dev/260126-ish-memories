The content consists of a chat log between two individuals, Soo and Insung. Soo reports struggling to write and trying to focus. Soo mentions that they threw their phone the previous day, resulting in slight screen damage and a broken camera. Soo expresses fear and anxiety about telling their mother about the phone, anticipating a lecture regarding a lack of responsibility even if the repair is paid for with Soo's own money. Soo notes that while they were able to hide things from their mother while living in Hong Kong, they now get caught approximately 70 percent of the time. Soo expresses a desire for independence.

Insung is supportive and agrees to meet Soo for a study session at a cafe in the Gangnam Station area. The meeting was initially discussed for 2:30 PM, but Soo requested to move the time to 3:00 PM because their mother insisted they eat a meal before leaving. Insung arrives at the cafe first and secures a seat for Soo by the window. Soo is late for the meeting, reporting their location at Maebong Station during the commute. Soo attributes the delay to being lectured or disciplined by their mother before leaving. 

The chat includes two specific location links from Naver Maps. The first is for Hawoo mala, located at Seoul Gangnam-gu Yeoksam-dong 818-7. The second is for MAUU, located at Seoul Gangnam-gu Yeoksam-dong 635-13. Insung is the subject who waits for Soo and provides emotional support during the exchange.
