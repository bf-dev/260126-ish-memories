The participants in the conversation are Soo and Insung. The dialogue involves a deep discussion regarding depression, the meaning of life, and suicidal ideation. Insung reacts with concern to Soo expressing a desire to die and a feeling that everyone is unhappy. 

Insung shares that she has faced similar existential crises and concluded that, in her current situation, graduation is the only practical solution. Insung reveals that she previously attempted suicide by jumping in front of a car. She survived and notes that at the final moment, she had a brief thought about whether it was right to end her life without giving herself the chance for other attempts or possibilities. Insung believes that a 기저에 깔린 생존본능 (underlying survival instinct) emerges when a person is at the brink of death.

Insung currently manages her mental state by sleeping when negative thoughts become too intense and by taking medication. She credits her current relatively healthy state to the medication, stating that she would likely attempt suicide again if she were not taking it. Insung describes life as a continuation of possibilities where one might find small amounts of happiness, which she believes is why humanity continues to exist despite life's hardships.

Insung mentions that she has a mental illness. She acknowledges that she has a boyfriend, but she clarifies that while she has found a justification for staying alive, she does not necessarily feel happy. Insung expresses that she cares deeply for Soo and tells Soo that she would not be able to cope if Soo were to die. She repeatedly asks Soo to call her if things get too difficult and asks Soo to stay alive.

Insung notes that she was previously envious of Soo because Soo has parents who care about her. The conversation reveals that Soo is currently in Hong Kong, and both Soo and Insung express dissatisfaction with being there. Soo mentions a specific incident from the previous day as an example of her inability to protect herself. Soo considers dropping out of school, but Insung advises against it, questioning if the school is the primary cause of Soo's distress. Insung admits she can no longer say she likes Hong Kong. The conversation ends with Insung telling Soo to sleep and suggesting they see each other the following day.
