Date of record: January 10, 2026.
Participants: Soo and Insung.

Context of conversation: The two individuals discuss the typical life path of male doctors in Korea, social equality, sexual identity, and Soo's personal financial privilege.

Details regarding the typical Korean male doctor career path: Soo describes a standard route for heterosexual male doctors in Korea which involves six years of medical school followed by residency. During this time, they typically date attractive women. In their 30s, they often meet wealthy women, frequently those specializing in the arts, through blind dates. They usually marry around age 35, have children, and the wife's family eventually funds the opening of their private medical clinic, allowing them to live as a clinic director. Soo considers this one of the most successful life paths for a heterosexual man in Korea.

Details regarding the Korean education system: Soo expresses the opinion that the Korean university entrance examination system is more equal than the American system. Insung mentions a person named SJH who attended a private autonomous high school (jasago). Insung notes that while such schools can represent inequality, the specific school was relatively inexpensive. Insung describes SJH as cute and mentions having liked him.

Details regarding medical licensing and moving abroad: Soo suggests that graduating from a Korean medical school might "bind" a person to Korea because the license is local. Insung counters this by stating that doctors can practice abroad if they take separate exams, noting that the procedures are not excessively complicated.

Details regarding queer life in Korea: Insung states that living as a gay man in Korea can be miserable due to the pressure to hide one's identity. Soo questions if one can just live openly, but Insung explains that it is difficult in the current Korean social climate. Soo expresses uncertainty about whether they can settle in Korea or if visibility is too important to them, which is why they are looking to move abroad to Canada.

Details regarding Soo’s financial privilege and family: Soo's father recently advised Soo to recognize their privilege and understand that others do not have the same options, so Soo should not question the life decisions of others. Soo’s mother recently reprimanded Soo for wanting to apply to multiple Canadian universities without researching them first, pointing out that application fees are expensive. Soo’s mother also criticized Soo for assuming they could simply stay at the family's house in Jeju during a leave of absence, reminding Soo that having a second home is not a standard option for most people.

Details regarding Insung’s financial background: Insung shares a contrasting experience regarding university applications. Insung did not receive parental consent or financial support for applications. To pay the application fees, Insung had to use personal living expenses, which resulted in Insung eating only meat and rice for an entire week, occasionally receiving food from friends.

Insung’s assessment of Soo’s status: Insung tells Soo that Soo's perception of their family being "just average" or "well-off" is unrealistic and detached from reality. Insung suggests that Soo's family is likely within the top 1% because Soo does not have to worry about money. Insung describes Soo as being "immature" (cheol-eops-eom) regarding financial realities but acknowledges that Soo is in an environment where they are allowed to be immature.
