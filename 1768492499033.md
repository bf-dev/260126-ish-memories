Insung worked on a project titled TIS Opportunities where he had a deadline of two weeks to build a service project application portal. The project required following strict school design guidelines. Insung used the Next.js framework and maintained a clean and simple design to meet the deadline efficiently.

Insung created a Creative Project which is a web application designed to teach statistical concepts. The application includes a section for Binomial Distribution that provides a formula, variable definitions, inputs for n and p values, and a button to repeat the process 1000 times. The interface contains navigation links for Geometric Distribution, Return to Home, and Take Quiz. Another section of the app explains the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) with a text description and a bar chart labeled Hyp illustrating Trial 186 with a result of 4 successes. This section includes interactive buttons for Random Distribution and Left Skewed. A third section displays Original Data with a Frequency of Numbers bar chart, Sample Numbers, and an average number calculation showing 3.23 rounded to 3. This section also features a Sample Means Frequency histogram.

In the context of his Creative Project, Insung is involved with VEX robotics. An image shows a complex metallic VEX robotics competition robot featuring gears, motors, and structural components in silver with red accents. The robot is positioned on a red carpeted surface typical of a competition environment.

Insung aims to continue his journey at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in the Bachelor of Science in Innovation and Technology (BSc(I&T)) program. His goals at HKU include solving real-world problems through hands-on projects, growing as an impact-driven and collaborative innovator, and learning to blend technology, design, and entrepreneurship.

Insung provided a Design Question Response focused on improving the quality of life for people with allergies. He identifies that millions of people with food allergies struggle to eat out safely because known allergens are difficult to detect in restaurant meals, leading to stress, limited options, and serious health risks. Insung notes that current problems persist because menus often lack ingredient or cooking method details, allergy requests are misunderstood, existing tools focus on emergency treatment instead of prevention, and current apps lack sufficient registered restaurant data.

Insung proposed a solution called SafeDining, which is a mobile application designed for finding allergy-safe restaurants.
