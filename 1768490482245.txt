The subject of the conversation is Insung. The other participant is Soo.

Insung currently feels that their personal state is poor and that their will is significantly diminished. Because of this state, Insung believes they lack the capacity to care for themselves and consequently do not currently desire a romantic relationship. Insung states that for someone to embrace them in their current condition, that person would need to be very sincere and caring. Insung believes that a relationship based on shallow sexual attraction is not sustainable.

During the conversation, Soo questions their own desirability and suspects that romantic approaches from others are based on either a lack of knowledge about Soo's true self or purely sexual motives. Soo initially suggests that Insung should clarify what they want out of a relationship, such as emotional exchange, understanding, support, companionship, or sex. Insung responds that they do not want anything specific because they do not value themselves at the moment.

Insung and Soo discuss the dynamics of sex and emotional validation. Soo admits to having considered trading sex for the feeling of being understood, despite recognizing this as a red flag. Insung argues that any understanding or kindness given as a trade for sex is not genuine and is ultimately toxic. Insung believes that if nice words are merely a performance to obtain sex, realizing the trade would be deeply unpleasant. Insung also notes that romantic relationships often feel like role-playing and mentions that roles exist even in same-sex relationships.

Soo mentions consulting an AI referred to as GPT, which advised Soo to develop self-respect. Following a negative past experience with an individual named Jang, Soo has established a personal bottom line: they will no longer engage in sex without commitment. Soo explains that they want to feel loved through sexual intimacy rather than experiencing the sense of futility or reality-check known as hyeon-ta. 

Insung agrees that sex outside of a committed relationship often leads to hyeon-ta, especially for someone like Soo. Insung observes that Soo is the type of person who is not well-suited for casual encounters because Soo falls for people easily when treated well. Insung distinguishes between genuine romantic interest and sexual attraction. 

Insung admits to feeling lonely lately. Insung also mentions that while they try not to appear needy, consuming alcohol makes them feel needy even in the absence of a romantic partner. Soo shares a quote from someone they admire, advising against letting loneliness drive one into a bad relationship. Insung agrees with this sentiment and acknowledges that they need a high-quality relationship, whether it be a friendship or otherwise.

Three photos were shared during the chat: one by Soo and two by Insung. The specific content of these photos is not described, though the first photo by Soo prompted a discussion about self-love.
