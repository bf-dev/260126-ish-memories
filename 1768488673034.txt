The conversation takes place between two individuals named Insung and Soo. The dialogue occurs around midnight as Saturday transitions into Sunday.

Insung and Soo discuss a scale of "furry" interests consisting of five stages. Insung mentioned the movie Zootopia and the character Nick Wilde the previous day. Soo believes stages up to level 2 are normal, while stage 5 is a true abnormal desire. Insung considers stage 4 to be somewhat abnormal. Nick Wilde is categorized as stage 4. Insung states that sexual attraction to the character Nick Wilde would be possible for him only if he were drunk and would be impossible while sober.

Insung and Soo discuss the social labeling of sexual desires. Soo mentions that a friend’s interest in a cross-dressed version of the politician Lee Jun-seok is a definitive example of an abnormal desire. Insung expresses intense disgust toward this specific concept and recalls having seen it before.

During the conversation, Soo steps in dog excrement. Insung tells Soo to keep walking and try to forget about it. 

Soo mentions that an unidentified woman sent her a direct message regarding a conversation record between Soo and Insung from a previous Monday. Soo is intentionally ignoring this woman and describes her as problematic. Insung advises Soo to continue ignoring her.

Both Insung and Soo agree on the need to live more "wholesome" lives. Soo expresses the opinion that decisions made based on sexual impulses lead to bad karma. Insung reflects that his past actions were often influenced by the social atmosphere rather than high libido. Insung claims that his libido is currently non-existent because he is struggling with other life difficulties. 

Soo discusses the vulnerability of mentally unstable women with high libidos, noting they are easy targets for crimes. Insung promises to help Soo stay on a wholesome path and protect her.
