The subject of this report is Insung. The course name is COMP1110 Computing and Data Science in Everyday Life. The document is a course information lecture presented on January 20, 2026. The instructor for the course is CM Liu. Chi-Man Liu, also known as CX, has an office located in room CB-316. His email address is imcx@hku.hk. He is a new lecturer who previously served as a software engineer and research assistant in bioinformatics for over ten years. Loretta Choi is another instructor with an office in room CB-322. Her email address is ykchoi@cs.hku.hk. She is a senior lecturer. The teaching assistants for the course are Xuelin Chen, Jolly Cheng, Xuebo Ji, Kelvin Lam, Tim Lai, Manwen Liao, Ye Tian, and Zerong Xie.

The course aims to define what computing and data science involve, addressing topics like programming, writing apps, artificial intelligence, bitcoin, and hacking. It helps students understand school course offerings and plan their three-year course of study. There are four course learning outcomes. The first is foundational understanding, which requires students to describe how computing, data science, and artificial intelligence impact daily life, including benefits, limitations, and societal implications. The second is practical problem-solving, which involves applying computational and data analysis techniques like simple algorithms and data visualization to real-world problems via hands-on projects. The third is collaborative innovation, which involves working in teams to design and present data-driven solutions with awareness of diverse perspectives. The fourth is ethical awareness, which involves identifying ethical challenges like privacy and bias.

The prerequisite for the course is basic Python programming, which means taking or having taken COMP1117 or an equivalent. Lectures take place on Tuesdays from 3:00 pm to 3:50 pm and Thursdays from 5:00 pm to 6:50 pm. Both lecture sessions are held in CPD-LG.01 Grand Hall. The schedule is subject to change, and students are advised to check the course Moodle. Tutorials consist of one 50-minute session per week starting in the third week. There are eight time slots to choose from, which will be announced in the second week. Enrollment for tutorials begins in the second week, and students must attend the same time slot every week.

Each lecture introduces a specific field in computing and data science, and some sessions feature guest lectures by professors. The fields covered include artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, algorithms, theory of computing, bioinformatics, cybersecurity, cryptography, computer graphics, computer animation, computer vision, data science, fintech, metaverse, human-computer interaction, robotics, networking, databases, distributed systems, and programming technologies for web, mobile, and games.

The assessment for the course is 100 percent continuous, and there is no final exam. The assessment includes a group project worth 90 percent and an in-class quiz worth 10 percent. No individual assignments are given. Details for the group project will be provided in February. A requirement for the project is that groupmates must be in the same tutorial slot. Consultation hours for Chi-Man Liu are Thursdays from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm in CB-316 or by email appointment. Consultation hours for teaching assistants will be announced on Moodle within the first week.

Plagiarism is defined as the use of another person's work, including materials, creations, ideas, and data, as if it were one's own without acknowledgement. This applies regardless of publication status or intent to deceive. A first attempt at plagiarism results in a written warning and a zero mark for the entire assignment or test. Students can appeal this to the Programme Director within one week. A subsequent attempt leads to a referral to the Programme Director and potentially the University Disciplinary Committee, which may impose penalties such as a published reprimand, suspension of study, fine, or expulsion. Both the student who copies and the student who provides the work for copying are penalized.

Generative artificial intelligence is allowed if students state the name and version of the tool and the prompts used. Good use of AI involves asking the AI, reading the answer, thinking about it, and doing a sanity check. Bad use involves copying the answer directly without review or understanding.
