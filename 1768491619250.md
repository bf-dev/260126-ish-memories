The conversation takes place between two individuals named Insung and Soo. Insung initiates the discussion by mentioning the philosophical concept of the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Insung states that he does not intend to die because he sees no reason to do so. Insung mentions that he forgot to take his medication and notes that if he does not bring his medicine when he goes to Korea, he could potentially die.

Soo expresses a desire to die, but Insung advises Soo to speak to a doctor about these thoughts when Soo goes to Hong Kong. Insung suggests that being in Hong Kong might increase Soo's suicidal ideation. Soo mentions having developed a mental health issue related to the need for control and expresses significant stress over things they cannot control. Insung tells Soo that Soo’s death would be very difficult for him to handle. Insung acknowledges that asking Soo not to die for his sake is selfish and tells Soo to feel free to die if it is too much, but expresses a strong preference for Soo to stay alive.

Soo clarifies that they currently have no immediate plans to die, but they state they will definitely die if they fail to get into university. Soo mentions a personal rule about not dying while in Hong Kong, but admits they might ignore that rule if the shock of university rejection is too great. Soo reveals that they have been staying alive with the thought that they would be finished with their current city in six months. If Soo fails to escape the city and has to stay in Hong Kong for two more years, they consider it a "suicide ending" or a "dropout ending," potentially followed by a working holiday.

Soo expresses guilt over being a financial burden to their parents, especially since they feel they did not study enough to justify the high cost of tuition and living expenses in Hong Kong. Insung suggests that Soo should not worry about being a financial burden because it is not a measurable metric and suggests that taking medication to feel numb while finishing school might be an option. 

Soo expresses feeling depressed and unintelligent. Soo initially hesitates to complain to Insung because they do not want to place an emotional burden on him, noting that Insung is currently in a situation where hearing negative things might have a heightened negative impact. Insung identifies himself as a T (Thinking) type according to MBTI, suggesting he may not be the best at emotional support, but he encourages Soo to vent to him anytime and promises to listen.

In terms of academics, Soo mentions needing to review first-year high school mathematics because they have to take a math course next semester. The specific course is identified as math1013. Insung mentions that he recently performed very poorly in that same course and suggests that he and Soo might end up taking the class together.
