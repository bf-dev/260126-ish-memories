Insung is a participant in a digital text conversation with an individual named Soo. Insung tells Soo that she is precious to him and that he feels this way naturally without a specific reason. Insung shares his perspective on depression, stating that having a specific reason for being depressed is better because it allows one to explain why they feel a certain way or why they are unable to do anything. He suggests that dealing with clinical mental illness is more difficult because it feels like a disease rather than a situational mood.

Insung provides advice to Soo regarding her self-destructive behavior. He supports Soo's decision to block the sub-account of an individual named Jang Ye-won. Insung believes that cutting off all means of communication is the best course of action for Soo’s well-being. Insung reflects on his own past mental health struggles, noting that at his lowest point, he found it difficult to block people and would rationalize that if he died, it would be the same as blocking them.

Insung discusses a person referred to as Andrew Tini. He describes Andrew Tini as a cute, far-right white man. Insung tells Soo that using such people as a form of emotional release or "self-harm" is at least better than physical self-harm because it does not leave physical scars. 

Insung shares personal details about his interests and romantic preferences. He mentions that after watching Heated Rivalry, his trauma regarding Russian men was cured, and he now considers them as potential romantic interests. He specifies a preference for a partner who whines in Russian rather than English so that he does not have to understand or be annoyed by the content of the whining. Insung describes a specific attraction to men who are in denial about their sexuality or who struggle to accept being gay. He characterizes himself as a "ha-nam-ja" (a term for a low-tier or pathetic man) in romantic contexts and states that if someone is cute, that is all that matters.

Insung critiques the behavior of Jang Ye-won, whom Soo describes as a "straight woman" who acts in sexually ambiguous ways toward women when drunk. Insung encourages Soo to stop thinking about Jang Ye-won and to stop ruminating on memories. He advises Soo to confess her feelings to Jang Ye-won and get rejected so that the connection can finally end. Insung argues that it is better for Soo to face the reality of being unwanted than to continue living in a state of "blurred vision" where she ignores the truth for temporary happiness. He notes that Soo has been ruminating on this person for weeks and needs to move on.
