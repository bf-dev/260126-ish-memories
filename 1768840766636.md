Document Title: 2022 Injaegwan Autonomous Committee Application.
Application Date: April 9, 2022.
Applicant Name: Insung Jo.
Student ID: 220126.
Current Grade and Class: Grade 1, Class 1.
Dormitory Room Number: L106.

Content Analysis Section 1: Motivation for Application.
Insung mentions his participation in the Youth Council Academy operated by the Student Council and the Provincial Council. He believes in the principle that students should govern their own affairs. He states that students have the right to express their opinions and should maintain dignity corresponding to those rights. Through autonomous committee activities, he wants to help Injaegwan students act independently and live according to established rules. He expresses a desire to lead Injaegwan as a place where students grow into Little Adults, viewing the dormitory as an extension of the classroom at Chungnam Samsung Academy.

Content Analysis Section 2: Desired Activities and Improvements.
Insung plans to collect student opinions regarding dormitory life regulations. He observes that students often break rules because they feel their opinions were not included and perceive the rules as unfair. He believes that if student opinions are incorporated, students will act with a greater sense of responsibility toward those rules. He identifies limitations in the current Best Clean Room (BCR) campaign, noting that it is not conducted on weekends, leading to a lack of organization during those times. He also points out that BCR only checks visible external spaces, meaning storage areas like drawers and closets are often left messy. Insung proposes a voluntary event where students organize their storage spaces without being forced. He suggests awarding prizes to students who submit photos of the most organized spaces. His goal is to help students make organization a habit.

Content Analysis Section 3: Reasons for Selection.
Insung states he participated in many student council activities during his three years of middle school. He believes he possesses all the necessary competencies for a dormitory committee member. He reports that he strictly follows all dormitory life rules and considers himself a representative student with no disqualifying factors. He defines leadership as the ability to move others. He intends to participate actively so that students can autonomously decide and follow rules with dignity. He acknowledges he is not perfect but expresses a commitment to growing alongside teachers and students.
