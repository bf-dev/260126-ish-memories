Insung joined TIS in the 11th grade and has been a student there for approximately 1.8 years. 

During his 11th grade year, Insung's academic schedule included AP Economics, AP Statistics, Honors Philosophy, and AP Computer Science A. In the 12th grade, he took AP Chemistry, AP Physics, AP Calculus BC, and Honors Survey and Development, which he also refers to as the Senior Seminar. Additionally, he self-studied for the AP Computer Science Principles course.

Insung's favorite memory from his time at TIS is the Senior Departure Seminar. He explains that because he arrived late to the school, he initially struggled to build relationships with his peers while focusing on adapting to the new environment. The seminar served as a pivotal moment where he was able to establish and strengthen those connections.

In terms of extracurricular activities, Insung is active in Theater and Model United Nations (MUN). He has participated in the TIANMUN conference twice. He was previously a member of the basketball team but decided to quit because he felt he lacked skill in the sport.

As of the interview, Insung has not yet applied to any universities. He is considering attending school in Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, or other countries in Asia. He plans to major in Computer Science, a field of study he has been interested in for a long time. His career goal is to become a programmer or work in a role related to computer science.

Following graduation, Insung plans to spend time gaining new life experiences, such as working a part-time job, which he believes will be helpful since he has not done so before. He also intends to focus on completing his college applications during this period.
