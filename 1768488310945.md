The conversation takes place on a Wednesday between Insung and a person named Soo, whose full name is mentioned as Sukyoung. Both Insung and Soo are twenty years old.

Insung describes himself as having a fragile mental state and being impulsive. He expresses a deep dislike for himself, identifying this self-loathing as the root of his problems. He struggles with high anxiety and frequently worries that he has done something wrong to others. Earlier on the day of the conversation, he asked Soo if he had done anything wrong to her. He feels he needs to live more constructively but admits he does not attend all of his school classes. Insung has a side job and is currently a student.

Insung and Soo both identify as being part of a marginalized group, specifically referring to themselves as queer. Insung shares that he previously attempted to change or overcome his queer identity but found it painful and unsuccessful. He expresses frustration with being categorized as a weak person and states he does not want to seek sympathy for his marginalized status, though he acknowledges it as a fact. He feels he is currently trapped in a cycle of self-pity.

Regarding relationships, Insung believes his current mental state is too difficult for others to handle. He agrees with Soo that casual encounters or short-term gratifications are not sustainable and do not provide real healing. He acknowledges that long-term patterns of seeking such illusions of healing will worsen his mental health.

On the day of the conversation, Insung woke up at 1:00 PM and spent time resting. He had been unable to sleep due to anxiety and took additional medication to resolve the issue and try to sleep. He proposed meeting Soo for dinner, offering to travel to her location, but Soo declined because she had a business social event. 

Soo mentioned she paid 200 units of currency to attend this business social event and noted that another entity or person named Hate paid 1500 to attend, despite the event or platform previously being free. Soo mentioned she is currently avoiding contact with someone named Arim.

Insung and Soo have plans to meet this coming Friday. Insung acknowledges that Soo thinks he is doing well objectively because he is maintaining his life, working a side job, and attending school, even though Insung himself feels he has not accomplished anything significant recently. The conversation concludes with both individuals expressing a desire to be happy and noting how time feels both fast and slow.
