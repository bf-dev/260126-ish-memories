Insung presents statistical analysis regarding the relationship between eating breakfast and morning energy levels for two different sample sizes. For a sample size of 500, the Chi-square statistic is approximately 4.20 and the p-value is approximately 0.122. Because 0.122 is greater than the significance level of 0.05, Insung notes there is no significant evidence of a relationship between breakfast and energy at this sample size. For a sample size of 1000, the Chi-square statistic is approximately 8.40 and the p-value is 0.015. Because 0.015 is less than 0.05, Insung notes there is significant evidence of a relationship between eating breakfast and morning energy level.

Insung provides a Chi-square test for independence regarding acne treatment and satisfaction levels. The null hypothesis states that treatment type and satisfaction level are independent, meaning there is no association. The alternative hypothesis states they are dependent, meaning there is an association. The Chi-square statistic is approximately 10.95 and the p-value is approximately 0.027. Insung rejects the null hypothesis because the p-value is less than 0.05, concluding there is a statistically significant association and that different treatments lead to different satisfaction levels.

Insung describes a regression line for texting among teenagers. The slope of the regression line is 0.4577. This indicates that as age increases, the predicted number of texts sent per waking hour increases by 0.4577.

Insung analyzes the distribution of researchers determining the composition of a placebo. In part a, binomial distribution probabilities are calculated for a sample size of 3 and a probability of 0.2. The probability of 0 successes is 0.512. The probability of 1 success is 0.384. The probability of 2 successes is 0.096. The probability of 3 successes is 0.008. In part b, expected numbers for 800 studies are calculated. The expected number of studies with 0 successful researchers is 410. The expected number with 1 success is 307. The expected number with 2 successes is 77. The expected number with 3 successes is 6. In part c, Insung performs a hypothesis test. The null hypothesis is that the number of researchers follows a binomial distribution, and the alternative hypothesis is that it does not. The chi-squared statistic is approximately 9.31 and the p-value is approximately 0.025. Insung rejects the null hypothesis, showing the observed frequencies do not follow a binomial distribution.

Insung lists probabilities for weight ranges under a normal distribution with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 5. The probability of weight below 12.5 lb is 0.0668. The probability of weight between 12.5 and 17.5 lb is 0.2417. The probability of weight between 17.5 and 22.5 lb is 0.3829. The probability of weight between 22.5 and 27.5 lb is 0.2417. The probability of weight above 27.5 lb is 0.0668.
