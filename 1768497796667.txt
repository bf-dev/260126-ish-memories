The conversation takes place on Thursday, January 15, 2026. The primary subject, Insung, expresses severe emotional distress and suicidal ideation, stating that he feels the need to jump off but does not know where to go. He describes his life and current situation as unfortunate. Insung has an upcoming trip to Hong Kong and believes that once he is there, he will no longer face hardships or will be able to die comfortably.

Insung speaks with an individual named Soo, who is identified in the text as Hwang Su-kyung. Soo admits to lying to her parents by claiming she filed for a leave of absence from school when she actually had not. Insung suggests that this lie is not a grave matter, even though Soo expects her parents to criticize her harshly for her poor task management, her inability to live abroad, and her general behavior. Soo wants to spend three to four days in Hong Kong, but her mother expressed anger at this request. Soo is required to give her mother a definitive answer regarding the trip by the following day. Insung advises Soo that she needs better improvisation skills to deal with her mother's controlling tendencies.

Soo shares a list of women she is currently in contact with, which she refers to as her mental health dopamine. The list includes a feminine woman born in 2008 who is fond of Soo, a casual woman born in 2006 with a swaggering appearance, a woman born in 2007 who asked Soo for hairstyle advice, another woman born in 2007 described as having a nerdy personality and short hair, and an older woman born in 2003 who is athletic and very busy. Insung identifies that Soo has a psychological tendency to obsess over people who like her and recommends she choose the woman born in 2008.

Soo discusses the possibility of seeking a sex partner or a Friend with Benefits (FWB) because she feels she is not meant for romantic love. Insung tells her that seeking such an arrangement is not morally wrong and is not a form of self-harm. Soo outlines specific criteria for a FWB: the person must be her physical type, must show her respect, must constantly check in on her, and should ideally be an older woman with more experience. Soo expresses a desire for someone to fill the role previously held by a person named Jang Ye-won. Soo describes this role as a person who provides care and constant contact. Insung tells Soo that it is impossible to find a replacement for Jang Ye-won, characterizing that person as a specific type who derives psychological pleasure from being relied upon.

Insung reflects on his own lack of psychological support, questioning if he is responsible for refusing to depend on others. He states that he is facing many problems and tasks that he must confront but feels unable to do so at the moment. He maintains the hope that things will improve or reach a resolution once he reaches Hong Kong.
