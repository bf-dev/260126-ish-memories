Participants: Insung and Soo (also referred to as Sugyeong)

Insung is currently traveling in Japan for the first time. He describes the weather in Japan as being very cold. He is traveling without a detailed plan or itinerary, though he mentioned a plan to visit Shinjuku the following day. Insung notes that this trip has the lowest risk of death compared to any of his previous travels.

Insung expresses a desire to become a more attractive person. He plans to achieve this by exercising to improve his waist and shoulders and by purchasing new clothes. He agrees with Soo's project of becoming a person with a good vibe or atmosphere.

Regarding his social life, Insung spent the previous week meeting many different people, but spent the current week mostly interacting with Soo. He feels that this week felt more like a god-saeng, a term referring to a productive or exemplary life, because of the quality of the interaction. Soo compliments Insung, telling him he is cute and encouraging him to pursue a relationship with a specific man they discussed.

Insung makes a joke about queer developers praying to Alan Turing in heaven to ensure their code remains error-free. He and Soo discuss the difficulty of finding a deity to pray to for success in same-sex dating.

Insung reacts to an image or emoticon sent by Soo, describing it as scary rather than cute and interpreting its expression as someone who knows everything.

Soo provides Insung with travel recommendations for Tokyo, including eating parfaits in Shinjuku and visiting a shop called Itoya. Soo shares a Google Maps link titled Travel Plan Sugyeong, which contains an itinerary from a trip Soo took to Tokyo the previous summer. Soo asks Insung to bring back konjac jelly from Japan.

Soo is currently in Hong Kong and mentions using Tinder there, though Soo is frustrated by seeing only Korean straight men on the app instead of potential female partners. Soo visited a hospital recently and reports feeling better after taking medicine.

Soo has a busy travel schedule, departing on a flight at 12:40 AM on the morning of October 12. Soo's father is scheduled to pick Soo up from the airport. Despite the late arrival, Soo has an appointment to meet a junior student later that same morning.

The conversation touches on music, with Soo mentioning lyrics by Ariana Grande regarding her personal life and the frequency of profanity in the song. Soo also reflects on past high school goals, which were to escape from Korea, be gay, and do crime.
