The file 2025-26 COMP2113BCD introduction (1).pdf contains 32 pages of course information for the class COMP2113B/C/D Programming Technologies at The University of Hong Kong for the 2025-2026 academic year. The instructors for the course are Chenxiong Qian and Zhenqin Wu. Instructor Chenxiong Qian can be reached at cqian@cs.hku.hk and Instructor Zhenqin Wu at zhenqin@hku.hk. The course is offered by the Department of Computer Science within the School of Computing and Data Science.

The teaching team is divided into two teams. Team A includes Instructor Chenxiong Qian and Teaching Assistants Lai Chun Kiu Tim (cklai@cs.hku.hk), Hongjin Su (hjsu@connect.hku.hk), Sun Chenxin (roniny@connect.hku.hk), Liang Jiaxi (u3013074@connect.hku.hk), and Ding Kaixin (kxding@connect.hku.hk). Team B includes Instructor Zhenqin Wu and Teaching Assistants Wong Kwan Ho (marcow12@hku.hk), Liangcai Su (u3011985@connect.hku.hk), Xie Zerong Tom (zrxie@cs.hku.hk), and Lu Yuxiang (yuxianglu@connect.hku.hk). Student Teaching Assistants are listed as to be determined.

Insung is expected to have prior knowledge of programming basics in Python, including syntax, identifiers, control statements, functions, recursions, strings, style, documentation, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and files. The course aims to teach software development technologies and tools to prepare Insung with solid programming skills for future computer science curriculum challenges.

The course has four primary learning outcomes. Outcome 1 involves the programming environment and technologies, where Insung will learn to work on the Linux platform using the Bash shell and shell scripts. Outcome 2 focuses on problem solving and program implementation using C and C++, debuggers, separate compilation, and makefiles. Outcome 3 covers advanced programming techniques including recursion, C++ classes, Standard Template Library, data structures, and algorithms. Outcome 4 is self-learning, where Insung is expected to effectively learn various programming techniques.

The course curriculum is structured into 11 modules numbered 0 through 10. Module 0 is Getting Started with Logging onto CS Servers. Module 1 is Linux Environment. Module 2 is Shell Script and Version Control. Module 3 is C and C++ Basics. Module 4 is Makefile, Programming Style, Basic Debugging, and Python/C++ Comparison. Module 5 is Functions. Module 6 is Arrays and Strings. Module 7 is File IO, Structures, and Recursion. Module 8 is Pointers and Memory Management. Module 9 is C++ Standard Template Library. Module 10 is C Specifics and GDB Debugger.

Insung will learn the C language because it is a predecessor to C++, is low-level and fast, and is used extensively in Linux and Unix systems. Linux is defined as an operating system providing an interface for hardware components like CPU, memory, and harddisk. Distributions mentioned include Redhat, Debian, FreeBSD, Fedora, and Ubuntu, with the departmental server specifically running Ubuntu. Linux is used because it is open-source, customizable, secure, and used for supercomputers such as Titan.

Ways to access Linux include dual-booting, running a virtual machine, or connecting to the servers academy11.cs.hku.hk or academy21.cs.hku.hk via SSH text mode. Insung should use FTP software like FileZilla to transfer files.

The course is primarily a self-learning course. The introductory lecture is the only lecture held. Programming Clinic support sessions start from February 3 at venue HW312. Session times for COMP2113B are Monday 9:00 AM to 10:50 AM, Tuesday 2:00 PM to 3:50 PM, and Friday 12:00 PM to 1:50 PM. Sessions for COMP2113C are Monday 11:00 AM to 12:50 PM, Tuesday 4:00 PM to 5:50 PM, and Friday 11:00 AM to 12:50 PM. Sessions for COMP2113D are Monday 1:00 PM to 2:50 PM, Tuesday 12:00 PM to 1:50 PM, and Friday 9:00 AM to 10:50 AM. Insung may join any of these sessions.

The tentative schedule for 2026 is as follows. Week 1 (Jan 19 to Jan 24) covers Module 0. Week 2 (Jan 26 to Feb 7) covers Module 1. Week 3 (Feb 9 to Feb 14) covers Module 2 and releases Assignment 1, due March 1. Week 4 (Feb 16 to Feb 21) covers Module 3. Week 5 (Feb 23 to Feb 28) covers Module 4. Week 6 (Mar 2 to Mar 7) covers Module 5, releases Assignment 2 due March 22, and releases the project due May 3. Week 7 (Mar 9 to Mar 14) is Reading Week. Week 8 (Mar 16 to Mar 21) covers Module 6. Week 9 (Mar 23 to Mar 28) covers Module 7 and releases Assignment 3 due April 12. Week 10 (Mar 30 to Apr 4) covers Module 8. Week 11 (Apr 6 to Apr 11) covers Module 9. Week 12 (Apr 13 to Apr 18) covers Module 10 and releases Assignment 4 due May 3.

Each of the 10 modules lasts 1 to 2 weeks and includes notes, readings, and checkpoint exercises. All module checkpoint exercises are due on May 3, 2026.

Assessment is divided into 70 percent Continuous Assessment and 30 percent Final Written Examination. Continuous Assessment includes Checkpoint Task Submissions (10 percent), 4 Programming Assignments (40 percent), and 1 Programming Project (20 percent). Assignments must be completed individually over roughly 2 weeks. Late submissions for assignments incur a 30 percent deduction within 2 days, a 50 percent deduction within 3 to 5 days, and no marks after that. ChatGPT is permitted for checkpoints and projects but strictly forbidden for assignments.

Assignment grading requires that code must compile and run in the standardized environment to receive credit. Plagiarism detection software will be used. Assignments are auto-graded for technical correctness. A rebuttal mechanism is available for technical errors. Plagiarism is defined as copying work without proper acknowledgment. A first attempt results in a zero mark for the component and a warning. Subsequent attempts are referred to the Programme Director and may lead to reprimand, suspension, fines, or expulsion.

The programming project involves groups of 2 to 5 students and lasts 6 to 7 weeks. Grading is individual and tracked via GitHub and peer review.

Insung is expected to spend 8 to 10 hours per week on the course. Moodle is the only official direct communication channel. Support is provided through Moodle Q&A, Programming Clinic sessions, and consultation appointments. Insung should be specific and provide context when asking for help and should not post assignment code on Moodle.

Reference materials include A Practical Guide to Linux by Mark G. Sobell, Online Linux tutorial by Matt Welsh, Problem Solving with C++ by Savitch and Mock, C++ How to Program by Deitel, and C++ Primer by Lippman. The course will highlight differences between C and C++ regarding strings, standard I/O, file I/O, and memory management.

To access student labs, Insung needs a CS computer account. This is obtained by visiting the CS homepage, clicking Intranet and then New Student, and logging in with HKU Portal credentials. This process provides a CS username, password, and door PIN.

The document ends with a visualization of topics including C, C++, PHP, Python, GIT, STL, Class, Overloading, grep, Iterator, Redirection, Shell script, Bash command, regex, makefile, and PIPE, with the phrase Practice makes perfect.
