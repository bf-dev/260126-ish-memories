The date of the record is June 23, 2025. Insung traveled to Yongsan to handle banking business, specifically to designate a primary foreign exchange bank and remit funds. He traveled via the Gyeongui-Jungang Line. Insung had only two hours of sleep, which he noted had a significant impact on his mental state and caused him to doze off during the train ride. During this time, he reflected on the concepts of ethical consciousness and social face, distinguishing between social reputation and holistic ethics. He mentioned a personal goal of creating a rule book for his own ethical standards, though he feels this may be delayed.

Insung had a bank appointment scheduled for 10:00 AM. He arrived early and noted the bank opened 15 minutes before his scheduled time. The banking process took longer than expected. While waiting, he watched promotional materials on a screen. He witnessed an incident involving a rude elderly man who demanded to see the branch manager.

Regarding his employment status, Insung has received an offer and possesses the necessary PDF files and a confirmation email. He decided to stop accessing the recruitment website entirely to avoid the risk of accidentally clicking a button to cancel his acceptance, stating the risk of such an error is now near zero percent because he will no longer log in.

Insung dealt with a rejection of his visa documents, which he resubmitted, likely from a Starbucks. The rejection was due to the omission of high school information. He expressed confusion over whether high schools have specific majors.

Later, Insung met with Wang Yijun and Kim Taeyul. He observed that Wang Yijun's personal atmosphere seemed to have changed. Insung reflected on the necessity of self-care, noting that it influences both how others perceive him and his own self-attitude. The group ate at Panda Express, which Insung described as American-style Chinese fast food. Afterward, they went to Hongdae to drink alcohol. Insung noted that his friends' basic states remained the same regardless of whether they were drinking. Insung returned home via subway and noted that the scenery during the ride was good.
