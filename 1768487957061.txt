In the morning, Olivia contacted Insung to tell him that she missed him and asked what he was doing.
Olivia sent a video of herself to Insung.
Insung replied to Olivia's message but had not received a response back at the time of the recording.
Insung went to take his driver's license exam and attended training sessions.
Insung arrived at the driving center exactly on time despite having a tight schedule.
Insung attended a mandatory three-hour safety education session.
Insung expected the safety education to be boring, but he found the instructor to be very good and the session engaging.
For a meal, Insung ate the A Set at Hongik Donkatsu.
Insung noted that the portion of the A Set was very large.
Insung practiced for the on-site functional driving test for approximately three to four hours.
The driving instructor was very kind and provided significant help to Insung.
Insung felt that he regained his sense of driving during the practice session.
Insung took the functional driving test and passed with a score of 100 points, receiving no deductions.
Insung originally planned to take the subway to Geumneung Station with his maternal grandmother but decided to go straight home instead.
After arriving home, Insung called his maternal grandmother and suggested they eat Budae-jjigae (army base stew).
Insung received an email from the University of Hong Kong requesting that he update his AP scores.
This email caused Insung significant worry and anxiety regarding his admission status.
Insung felt that if his AP scores were not good, his admission might be canceled.
Insung mentioned that while he is not certain his scores are bad or that they will be below a 4, the request for an update on a confirmed admission made him depressed.
Due to the stress regarding the university email, Insung lost his appetite and could barely eat his meal.
Insung went bowling with others because he felt he could not say no to the social activity.
Insung finished in last place in bowling because he was in a state of mental distress and could not focus.
A person named Yeon-ji beat Insung at bowling, which he found surprising because she does not know how to play.
Insung got a lot of oil on his hands from the bowling equipment and washed them before heading home.
Insung's aunt gave him money, which he estimated to be around 60,000 won.
Insung plans to use the money given by his aunt for a trip to Sapporo.
After returning home, Insung ate leftover seasoned chicken (yangnyeom chicken).
Insung watched Netflix and then went to sleep.
