The date of the record is July 1, 2025. On the morning of July 1, Insung accompanied his maternal grandmother to a driver's license examination center. The grandmother registered for a driver's license course and paid an academy fee of approximately 900,000 KRW. She is scheduled to attend the center on the following Thursday for her on-site functional test. Further schedules for her training and testing are to be determined later. Insung spent the early part of the morning lying down and felt he had been unproductive. During this time, he dealt with a difficult individual who asked an excessive number of questions and made heavy demands despite having paid a small amount of money. This interaction made Insung angry, though he provided a response.

Between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM, Insung traveled to Ilsan Station. He purchased water at a Storyway convenience store and took a bus to Kintex. He observed that Kintex was quiet and relatively empty, with only one exhibition running and outdated COVID-19 signs still posted. While walking toward the exhibition hall, Insung was contacted by Olivia. Olivia informed him she was at the airport. She had been traveling, which was the reason for the lack of recent contact. Insung had not contacted her either, as he does not initiate contact if the other person does not. 

After looking around the Kintex exhibition hall, Insung headed toward the E-Mart and Starfield Mall area. He took a shortcut and passed a construction site for the Waterbomb festival. Although he was interested in the festival, he decided not to go because the ticket price was too high and he did not think he would enjoy it sufficiently. At E-Mart Traders, Insung ate a meat-filled bake bread that cost approximately 4,900 to 5,000 KRW. He walked around the mart, drank water, tried food samples, and visited Electro Mart to see electronic products. He also walked around the floor where Starbucks is located. He noted that a Musinsa Standard store is scheduled to open at that location in September or October. He briefly went outside but returned indoors due to the extreme heat.

Insung received a text message from his aunt while he was planning his return trip. He traveled from Kintex Station to Unjeong Jungang Station using the GTX. From there, he took a bus and transferred to arrive at Soejae Village. Near the elevator, Insung met his cousin Ga-yeon. Ga-yeon was suffering from a cold and otitis media (a middle ear infection) and had been to a pediatric and adolescent clinic. Insung found it notable that the pediatric clinic sold smoking cessation medicine. He noted that while Ga-yeon is frequently sick and has a history of surgeries and hospitalizations, his other cousin, Kang Min-seo, rarely gets sick. 

Insung and Ga-yeon went to a vegetable shop and purchased tangerines. They also visited a side dish shop and bought squid and other items. They obtained pork ribs and meat dumplings, the latter of which Insung found very delicious. Insung had dinner at his aunt's house, where they ate the pork ribs, side dishes, and dumplings. Insung drank one can of beer and felt slightly tipsy. After spending time talking, Insung returned home. The file name for this record is 2025-07-01.md.
