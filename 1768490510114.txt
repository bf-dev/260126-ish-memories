The conversation is between Soo and Insung. Soo expresses that she has given up on finding new friends for the time being to protect her mental health.

Insung finishes cleaning his room and is lounging. Soo reports that she fell asleep right after her last message and has just woken up and showered. Insung also just woke up. Insung suggests eating pasta for lunch. Insung invites Soo to go to China with him the following day, Sunday. The planned departure time is 10:00 AM. Insung mentions that he recently took a Calculus exam and felt he performed poorly, describing himself as feeling stupid despite the exam appearing easy. The plan for the trip to China involves going at 10:00 AM, studying at a cafe, and having dinner. Soo intends to use the cafe study time to finish assignments she has been procrastinating on. Insung informs Soo that a counselor told him that having a medical certificate can often help in getting assignment deadlines extended. Soo decides to go out to eat. Insung eats at the school cafeteria. Soo finds a meal promotion for 43 HKD which includes tomato noodles, beef skewers, and milk tea. Soo later discovers the meal was inexpensive because the tomato noodles did not include any meat. Soo mentions that she is wearing contact lenses today and remarks on how clear the world looks.
