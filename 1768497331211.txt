Fact Record for Insung and Soo's conversation on Monday, December 29, 2025.

Communication occurred between two individuals named Soo and Insung.

A man named Andrew sent a message to Soo expressing his feelings. The messages included the phrases "i like u a lot," "I want to see you again," and "I miss u." Soo did not consider this a formal confession of wanting to date but found the timing strange, noting it would have been more expected two weeks prior. Soo responded by asking Andrew if he was drunk. Insung suggested Andrew might have been influenced by late-night emotions.

Soo reported a frustrating interaction with an individual named Jang. When Soo mentioned she did not want to go home, Jang replied that he liked his own house. Soo called Jang a derogatory name in response. Jang then sent a selfie and told Soo to let go of her anger. Soo is currently ignoring his messages. Insung observed that Soo seems to be treated like a toy by Jang, which Soo admitted is a dynamic she accepts because she needs him.

Insung reported being in a state of heavy intoxication while traveling home. He mentioned that his physical appearance was so poor that he returned home earlier than planned. Insung expressed a belief that he might have ADHD because he cannot focus and stated his intention to visit a hospital to inquire about a diagnosis. Insung felt too lazy to eat a meal and considered drinking only Pocari Sweat to last until dinner, despite Soo's insistence that he should eat.

Soo traveled to Pangyo to meet her father at his workplace. She requested that he buy her food because she had no other plans. Since her father was busy at the office, Soo planned to wait in a first-floor cafe until his lunch break.

Soo purchased a new electronic cigarette after her previous purchase turned out to be of poor quality. The new device is passion fruit flavored and described as tasting sweet. Soo noted the device is large and likely cannot be finished within two weeks, meaning she will have to transport it discreetly later.

Soo traveled via subway. She described her appearance as being "at a legendary level" of messiness, having only washed her face and tied her hair before leaving. While on the subway, she noted a girl sitting next to her who was cute and had a pleasant scent.

The conversation concluded with a lighthearted exchange regarding gender and identity. Soo used the phrase "Women are the best," and Insung noted he could not use that phrase in the same way. The chat ended with a joke about Insung's self-identification or sexual orientation.
