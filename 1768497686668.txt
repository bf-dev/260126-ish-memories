The following facts are recorded from a conversation between Insung and Soo on Monday, January 12, 2026.

Insung reported experiencing a period of unexplained, intense happiness, describing himself as feeling high and not in his right mind. He noted that this state is rare for him as he typically suffers from severe depression and stays in a low, down mood. Due to his usual depression, he often feels unable to express himself properly to others.

During this high state, Insung sent a series of messages to Soo. He told Soo that Soo is a very precious person and referred to Soo as a cute twink. He apologized for his usual lack of communication and for being constantly down. He encouraged Soo not to overthink things or feel guilty about perceived failures, stating that Soo is a better person than Soo thinks. Insung expressed his love and gratitude toward Soo.

Insung later clarified that he had not been drinking alcohol and that his state was purely a natural high. He eventually took a stabilizer to calm down and return to a more normal state. Earlier that day, Insung had met a friend briefly but returned home early because he was struggling with low physical stamina.

Regarding his romantic life, Insung expressed a sense of disillusionment and exhaustion with dating men. He stated he no longer wants to meet men and described feeling a longing for heterosexuality or social normalcy. He admitted to engaging in dating behaviors similar to Soo's in an attempt to seek validation.

Soo shared details of their own life during the conversation. Soo mentioned being recently blocked without warning by a butch woman who had claimed to like Soo just the day before. To cope with this, Soo engaged in what they called a mental victory by quickly finding a new person to meet.

Soo went on a date with a woman they met through Instagram. They had originally connected because Soo listed their Instagram handle on a dating app similar to Grindr. The date took place in Gangnam and was described as very wholesome. The pair visited a cafe and Kyobo Bookstore, where the woman gave Soo a bookmark. They spent time folding paper and discussing movies and their ideal types.

The woman Soo met is one year younger than Soo and stands 168cm tall. Soo described her as very beautiful and not pretentious. The woman was open about her past dating history, which made Soo feel comfortable. While Soo felt the date greatly boosted their self-esteem, they were unsure if the relationship was sustainable and viewed it more as a potential friendship because they shared too much personal information too quickly. The woman asked to meet Soo again the following day. Soo expressed a desire to tell the woman that they need to work on themselves before entering a relationship.

Soo remarked that their slut era and lesbian life had effectively started in Korea, aided by the use of dating applications. While Insung found the wholesome nature of Soo's date surprising given how they met, Soo explained that having a normal date that was not primarily sexual was a new and positive experience.
