Insung wore a denim jacket yesterday and experienced extreme cold. Soo used hyperbolic language about jumping into the Han River and suicide in response to a woman she dislikes. Soo states that this woman triggers her trauma, although she admits the woman did nothing wrong personally. Insung suggests that old memories are covered by new ones and mentions having his own bad memories associated with a specific place that he eventually healed from by revisiting it.

A woman, referred to as Yu A-rim, left a comment with three flirting emojis on Soo's post. Soo believes these emojis represent a sense of friendship, loyalty, or mutual support among women. Soo still has access to Yu A-rim's secondary Instagram account. Yu A-rim has kept Soo on her Close Friends list on that account, whereas Soo has removed Yu A-rim from her own Close Friends list. Insung describes Yu A-rim as tough and indifferent. Soo describes themselves as sensitive and having mental health struggles, using terms like menhera and jeong-byeong-nyeo.

Insung expresses a wish for someone to administer medication via injection for various conditions, such as hangovers, mental health issues, and fevers, because he finds taking pills and managing health tasks bothersome. Insung has prominent dark circles under his eyes that are difficult to cover even with foundation. He is feeling tired but is unsure of the specific cause.

Soo jokingly expresses a desire to be wealthy, specifically mentioning becoming the 43rd wife of Mansour. Insung wants to receive money without any conditions. Insung notes that while he does not have specific items he wants to buy lately, he has many expenses and currently lacks money because he previously bought everything he wanted.

Soo received a Direct Message from a high school boy after making her Instagram account public and posting a photo. The boy asked if Soo was a college student and suggested meeting. Soo confirmed she is a college student but ignored him because of the age gap and his gender. Soo has decided not to date men anymore after a past experience with a person referred to as SJH. Soo also expresses a lack of interest in dating women, describing the process of dating as bothersome. Insung agrees that dating seems like a burden.

Soo observed that making an Instagram account public and tagging locations allows nearby people to contact her, similar to the mechanism of dating apps like Tinder. Insung shares that when he is drunk, he gives his Instagram handle to people who ask. He gives his public account to women and his private account to men, but he usually has no memory of doing this the next day. Insung suggests that high school boys use Instagram like a dating app because they are too young to use actual dating applications. A person named Yewon is mentioned as having commented on a post.
